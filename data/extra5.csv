Biden administration approves first major offshore wind project in US waters,2
"The Biden administration announced Tuesday that it is moving forward with the nation's first large-scale offshore wind project, a significant step toward achieving President Joe Biden's goal of increasing US renewable energy production.",2
"Interior Secretary Deb Haaland described the project's approval as ""an important step toward advancing the Administration's goals to create good-paying union jobs while combating climate change and powering our nation.""",2
"""Today is one of many actions we are determined to take to open the doors of economic opportunity to more Americans,"" she said in a statement.",2
"estimated to create 3,600 jobs and power 400,000 homes and businesses, according to the Interior Department.",2
Renewable energy has been a focus of the Biden administration since early in the President's tenure. ,2
"And in March, the administration announced a massive, coordinated effort to bolster offshore wind energy projects in the United States in order to jump-start a ""clean energy revolution.""",2
"As part of that initiative, which spans multiple government agencies, the Departments of the Interior, Energy and Commerce committed to a shared goal of generating 30 gigawatts of offshore wind in the US by 2030. ",2
The March initiative came less than a week after the Biden administration had announced its goal of reducing solar electricity costs by 60% over the next decade.,2
"Environmental implications are a big focus of the President's American Jobs Plan, a roughly $2 trillion infrastructure proposal that he has said would create hundreds of thousands of jobs while tackling the climate crisis, reducing emissions and building a ""modern, resilient and fully clean grid.""",2
Biden kicked off a two-day virtual White House climate summit last month attended by 40 other world leaders by announcing an ambitious reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions as he looks to put the US back at the center of the global effort to address the climate crisis and curb carbon emissions.,2
Biden administration reverses Trump-era policy that blocked undocumented students from pandemic aid,2
"The Biden administration is expanding eligibility for pandemic relief aid to include undocumented and international college students, reversing a Trump-era policy that blocked them from receiving federal emergency grants.",2
"That interpretation of the law also blocked immigrants protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was upheld by the Supreme Court last year in response to the Trump administration's attempt to end it.",2
The Trump-era policy became the subject of court battles in several states and provoked outcry from Democratic lawmakers such as Sen. ,2
"Murray praised the Biden administration's announcement Tuesday, saying she is ""so relieved"" by the decision.",2
The latest round of funding is the biggest yet for colleges and universities. The latest relief bill also provided about $800 million to support students experiencing homelessness.,2
"The earlier rounds of grant aid, authorized by Covid relief packages passed by Congress last year, excluded undocumented students.",2
The new Education Department rule comes as the agency releases the roughly $36 billion in emergency aid now available for postsecondary education,2
"Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene confronted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez outside the House chamber on Wednesday afternoon, the latest of several confrontations Greene has had with her Democratic colleagues.",2
"Ocasio-Cortez left the House chamber late Wednesday afternoon ahead of Greene, who shouted ""Hey Alexandria"" twice to get her attention",2
"Greene caught up with Ocasio-Cortez and began shouting at her and asking why she supports antifa, a far-left activist group, and Black Lives Matter, falsely labeling them ""terrorist"" groups.",2
"Greene shouted at Ocasio-Cortez that she was failing to defend her ""radical socialist"" beliefs by declining to publicly debate her.",2
"Greene told reporters after Ocasio-Cortez ignored her, referring to her request in tweets to debate on the Green New Deal.",2
Audio clips of the incident which confirmed portions of the language Greene used were provided to CNN by the Capitol Hill press pool.,2
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed the incident happened during her weekly news conference on Thursday and suggested it might be for the House Ethics Committee to investigate.,2
"""It was reported to our office what happened as members were leaving the floors yesterday, the verbal assault and abuse of our colleague, congresswoman AOC. ",2
"It's so beyond the pale of anything that is in keeping with bringing honor to the House or not bringing dishonor to the House,"" she said.",2
"""It's so beyond the pale that you wonder, it probably is a matter for the Ethics Committee. But that's up to someone. I've always kept the leadership offices separate from any motions to take anything to Ethics.""",2
"It's that I refuse to allow young women, people of color, people who are standing up for what they believe, to see this kind of intimidation attempts by a person who supports White supremacists in our nation's capital.",2
"In comments to reporters on Capitol Hill, Greene denied Thursday that she was screaming at Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday.",2
You chickened out bc you are too scared to debate me about your Socialist Green New Deal. ,2
You are also a hate-America terrorist sympathizer. ,2
"JihadSquad Members of Congress do NOT support terrorism & shouldn't be afraid to debate their legislation.""",2
"This is not the first time Greene, a freshman Georgia Republican who was stripped of her committee assignments because of incendiary and violent past statements, has had run ins with her Democratic colleagues in the House.",2
Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office away from Greene following a heated exchange in January where Bush confronted Greene about not wearing a mask in a hallway on Capitol Hill.,2
"The fallout led Pelosi to take the extraordinary step of ordering Bush's office to be moved away from Greene, following a request from Bush.",2
Concerns about sweeping voting rights bill grow among Senate Democrats,2
Senate Democrats privately signaled concerns Thursday about pushing ahead with a vote on the sweeping voting rights and ethics bill that had become a top priority for Democratic leaders and progressive outside groups -- at least without first making changes.,2
Joe Manchin -- a crucial vote in Democrats' narrow majority -- would not back S1,2
"known as the For the People Act, which Democrats see as a way to blunt Republican state-level efforts to restrict voting access.",2
"Manchin, who was not at Thursday's meeting because he's traveling with first lady Jill Biden in his home state, suggested instead that the path forward lies in pushing legislation that would have a narrower scope.",2
"One source familiar with the discussion at Thursday's meeting said that lawmakers signaled that while they had signed onto S1, they still had changes they wanted to make -- some of them significant. ",2
"Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told the caucus that some things in the bill still needed to be adapted and that it was one thing to have a bill that was seen as a messaging bill and another thing to vote on the legislation as it is.",2
A spokesman for Warner declined to comment.,2
"The major voting rights package would mandate 15 days of early voting, allow same-day voter registration and limit states' ability to curb mail-in voting and the use of ballot boxes.",2
"It also rewrites federal campaign finance rules, sets out new ethics requirements for the president and seeks to end partisan gerrymandering.",2
"It wasn't clear from the meeting, according to the source, what the next step for the bill would be after the Rules Committee deadlocked along partisan lines on passing the bill out of committee earlier this week, revealing the tough path ahead for the Democratic legislation.",2
While Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer could still bring the bill to the floor,2
the vote in committee was a reminder that the legislation will not have the 60 votes needed to pass and has no Republican support.,2
Manchin had previously expressed reservations about moving forward with a far-reaching measure without bipartisan support.,2
His suggestion for legislation that can move forward -- the John Lewis Voting Rights Act -- is a bill far less sweeping.,2
"But it would bring back major pieces of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, including a provision that require states to consult with the federal government before making major changes to their voting rules.",2
Manchin's support of that bill was first reported by ABC News.,2
"In recent weeks, Manchin has had conversations with Democratic colleagues Rep. ",2
"Jim Clyburn and Sen. Raphael Warnock, both of whom have fought to pass the For the People's Act.",2
"On Tuesday, Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, repeatedly took aim at the 800-plus-page legislation with a raft of amendments that forced Democrats to cast a series of controversial votes.",2
Gaetz ally plans to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors,2
"The ex-Florida tax collector with close ties to Rep. Matt Gaetz is planning to plead guilty on Monday in a federal court in Florida, according to a new filing Thursday",2
"As part of the deal, Joel Greenberg will cooperate with investigators in a wide-ranging probe, according to one source familiar with the matter. ",2
"For months, federal investigators have been examining whether Gaetz broke federal sex trafficking, prostitution and public corruption laws and whether he had sex with a minor.",2
"CNN has previously reported that Greenberg has been speaking with federal investigators since last year, including providing information about how he and Gaetz allegedly had encounters with women who were then given cash or gifts for sex.",2
"The court document made public on Thursday set the hearing for Monday to be a ""change of plea."" ",2
"The former tax commissioner in Seminole County, Florida, and a friend of Gaetz's, Greenberg had faced decades in prison on 33 federal counts that ranged from identity theft to sex trafficking of a minor.",2
"The behavior of Gaetz and the other high-powered men at the events, and a pattern of digital payments that followed, will likely be items of interest to the Justice Department as part of its probe of Gaetz.",2
"Greenberg started speaking with investigators when he realized it was his only path to leniency in the face of considerable evidence against him, two people briefed on the matter told The New York Times in April.",2
Federal investigators are examining allegations that Gaetz had sex with an underage girl who was 17 at the time and with women who were provided drugs and money in violation of sex-trafficking and prostitution laws. ,2
"Federal investigators are also seeking to determine whether Gaetz was provided with travel and women in exchange for political favors as part of a broader probe, people familiar with the investigation tell CNN.",2
Supreme Court considers plea from parents of man killed in St. Louis jail who was shackled facedown,2
"When the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors on Thursday, the justices will discuss a case brought by parents who say their son, Nicholas Gilbert, died in police custody in St. Louis after law enforcement officers placed their weight on his back as he was shackled facedown.",2
"In court papers, the parents compare elements of the death of their son -- who was White -- with the murder of George Floyd. ",2
"The allegation produced an angry response from the city that accused the parents of using the death of Floyd ""as a cudgel to try to browbeat this Court into reviewing a case that is a straightforward application of basic Fourth Amendment procedures.""",2
The case is being watched for any signal of the justices' willingness to step in and offer more definitive guidance on the legal doctrine of qualified immunity that shields law enforcement from liability for constitutional violations including allegations of excessive force.,2
Petitions are likely to continue to flow into the court at a time when tensions across the country are particularly high.,2
"Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, an officer is not liable, even if he or she violates the Constitution, unless it was ""clearly established"" that the conduct was unconstitutional.",2
Critics say the bar is too high and want the Supreme Court to revisit the issue in a substantive way. ,2
"Paul Hughes, a McDermott Will & Emery LLP lawyer who has unsuccessfully petitioned the court on the issue",2
"noted that Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor have ""both expressed deep reservation with the judge-made doctrine, and it is being applied with wild inconsistency across the country.",2
"Last term, the justices declined to take up several cases concerning qualified immunity, and now the Gilbert case focuses sharply on excessive force.",2
"For Hughes, the Gilbert case ""presents a fact pattern now well-known after George Floyd -- 'positional asphyxiation",2
"Because this is a common police tactic, and it all too often results in death, it is crucial that the Supreme Court provide definitive guidance regarding the Constitution's prohibition on the use of excessive force in this context,"" Hughes said",2
"St. Louis City Counselor Michael Garvin told the Supreme Court that the ""undisputed facts"" show that ""little or no force was exerted on Gilbert's back, nor was any force exerted while he was inert and unresisting.""",2
"and added that a ""grandstanding assertion"" that a lower court opinion in favor of the city ""has any bearing on situations like that reported in the case of George Floyd is wholly fatuous.""",2
"The case first appeared on the docket in November, but the court rescheduled it for consideration some 13 times before discussing it for the first time last month and scheduling it again for Thursday's closed-door conference. ",2
The repeated rescheduling suggests that at least one justice may have taken some kind of interest in the case along the way.,2
"The case currently under consideration concerns the issue of ""prone restraint"" and is brought by Jody Lombardo and Bryan Gilbert",2
Gilbert's family sued the officers in their individual capacities and the city for an unconstitutional policy that they said violated Gilbert's rights.,2
"A federal appeals court recited the facts of the case: On December 8, 2015, officers arrested Gilbert who was cooperative at first and checked ""no"" to a question asking whether he had a medical condition.",2
The appeals court noted that lawyers for Lombardo presented a conflicting expert report alleging that the cause of death was forcible restraint inducing asphyxia. ,2
Garvin told the Supreme Court that it should allow the lower court opinion to stand.,2
"That the arrestee's seriously diseased heart did not withstand the strain was an unfortunate and unintended outcome, but not the result of a constitutional violation warranting review by this court,"" Garvin wrote",2
"Courts, he added, ""do not sit to second-guess the conduct of officers who are confronted with tense, rapidly evolving, exigent circumstances, but are to evaluate that conduct from the viewpoint of a reasonable officer on the scene.""",2
A district court found in favor of the police officers based on qualified immunity holding that there was no clearly established Fourth Amendment right against the prone restraint used against Gilbert at the time of the incident. ,2
"The 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying that no reasonable jury could find that the officers used excessive force and that the officers' actions ""did not amount to constitutionally excessive force.""",2
notes that the appeals court decision that went against his client has already been invoked by other police officers in other cases -- including by one of the officers in the George Floyd killing,2
"He notes that as things stand, the Supreme Court's excessive force doctrine is highly dependent on the specific factual context of each individual case and that it would be a mistake to lump together as ""equally problematic all uses of force against suspects in prone positions."" But still, he thinks the court should offer more guidance.",2
"The application of this doctrine to people in a prone position is an area where we could use more clarity from the court, but it's hard to get clear, bright-line rules in this area of the law,"" Schweikert said in an interview",2
Federal prosecutor overseeing Rudy Giuliani probe stepping down,2
"The chief of the public corruption unit at the Manhattan US Attorney's office, which is handling the criminal investigation of Rudy Giuliani, is stepping down at the end of the week to return to private practice",2
"Edward Diskant, who has been a prosecutor at the office for nine years, is set to be replaced as public corruption chief by Rebekah Donaleski, one of the prosecutors who has been leading the Giuliani investigation, the person said.",2
A spokesman for the US Attorney's office declined to comment.,2
"Under Diskant's watch, the public corruption unit has pursued some of the office's highest-profile investigations and prosecutions",2
"The Giuliani investigation, which began more than two years ago, escalated late last month as federal agents executed search warrants on his Manhattan home and office.",2
"Diskant is expected to join the law firm McDermott Will & Emery as a partner in its New York office, focusing on white-collar criminal defense and litigation.",2
The left is split and searching for a path in topsy-turvy New York mayoral race,2
"Dianne Morales, Scott Stringer and Maya Wiley are each seeking progressive support in the New York City mayoral race.",2
The race to consolidate the progressive vote in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor has turned into a three-for-all,2
with a trio of candidates vying to unify the increasingly influential but often fractious movement as the campaign enters its final stretch.,2
In a stop-and-start campaign that has been overshadowed at turns by the coronavirus pandemic and a series of scandals enveloping Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo,2
the city's ascendent left-wing coalition has so far failed to coalesce behind a single candidate by the coronavirus pandemic and a series of scandals enveloping Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo,2
A failure to consolidate or hash out a strategic voting plan before June 22's ranked-choice vote would likely spell doom for the campaigns and mark a disappointing missed opportunity for progressives in a city that has become a launching pad for some of the new left's brightest stars.,2
Though democratic socialist-aligned candidates are expected to gain a new foothold in the city council this year,2
"the liberals seeking City Hall's top job are lagging behind moderates Andrew Yang, the businessman-turned-2020 Democratic presidential candidate",2
"and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police officer and state legislator -- both of whom have sought to keep the activist left at arm's length.",2
"The splintering of progressive support among City Comptroller Scott Stringer, civil rights lawyer Maya Wiley, and former nonprofit executive Dianne Morales ",2
"Before then, though, the campaign is expected to enter a bruising stretch where the field of eight could be whittled down and candidates begin to consider their posture as Election Day closes in.",2
"we're at this polling position at the end of April, let's see what four weeks of paid media do,"" progressive political strategist Luke Hayes told CNN. ",2
And then I think the end of May is where you might start to see some of those coalitions where the progressive candidates might endorse each other,2
"Stringer, a decades-long veteran of liberal New York politics",2
"but his bid took a hit after a former political ally, Jean Kim",2
accused him of groping her and making other unwanted sexual advances during his 2001 campaign for public advocate,2
Stringer repeatedly denied the claims and dismissed calls for him to drop out of the race.,2
"Meanwhile, his campaign has highlighted inconsistencies -- including a number described in an investigation by The Intercept ",2
"But Kim, a lobbyist, is standing by her story and has filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office.",2
Kim's allegations both unsettled Stringer's rise and put some of his highest-profile backers under pressure.,2
"Many of them, including New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, state Sens. Alessandria Biaggi and Jessica Ramos, and the liberal Working Families Party rescinded their support. ",2
"The New York chapter of the climate activist group Sunrise Movement also stood down after Kim went public, putting all their chips in with Morales.",2
"The United Federation of Teachers, the 200,000-strong city teachers union, has stuck by Stringer, who has kept almost all of his labor support and recently added Teamsters Local 237",2
The WFP tossed its rankings after dropping Stringer ,2
"At this moment in the race, we believe the best role for the party is to unite progressives around these two powerful progressive women and ensure the city is in the best hands possible to rebuild and reimagine a city that works for all of us,"" WFP state director Sochie Nnaemeka said in a statement.",2
"Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change, a WFP-aligned group that endorsed Stringer back in March but has since withdrawn its backing",2
"said many progressive organizations were sent ""reeling"" by the accusations and are now considering their options in the midst of a quickly evolving race.",2
"People believe that she has the ability to build the coalition and take on Yang and Adams,"" Westin said.",2
"Stringer is still fighting and (there is a question of) whether he can convince voters that he can be trusted and, frankly, convince them on whether the allegations are true or not",2
"In an interview after a brief news conference in Queens last week, Stringer sought to draw a comparison between his hoped-for personal political ""comeback"" and the challenges facing the city. ",2
"He also downplayed the disappearing endorsements while pointedly reminding voters that, before the accusations against him surfaced, ""I got them all.""",2
"""People knew that I was the best qualified candidate for mayor or they wouldn't have endorsed me in the first place,"" Stringer said. ",2
"With the debate over Kim's allegations seemingly at a stalemate, Stringer is hoping to recapture any wavering progressive support and layer it with moderates who contributed to his winning citywide coalitions in 2013 and 2017 with a coming surge of paid media.",2
"I was 20 points behind Eliot Spitzer in the (2013) race for comptroller, which everybody said was a lost cause,"" Stringer recalled.",2
"While Stringer, his allies and fence-sitting progressives await the next round of public polling -- the most recent numbers showed him climbing",2
but that polling was conducted mostly before Kim came forward -- the Wiley and Morales campaigns are positioning themselves to seize on the upheaval.,2
"A former counsel to the term-limited, outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio, Wiley, who left her most recent job as popular liberal commentator on MSNBC to run for mayor, has been lingering in the outer ring of the top tier of candidates. ",2
"Speaking to CNN last week in Herald Square in midtown Manhattan, Wiley argued that political observers had written her off too soon. ",2
"If there is one near-unanimous sentiment among the campaigns, and across the ideological board, it is that the race itself has not yet won the attention of most voters",2
"Exhausted by the presidential election and the four years that was Donald Trump -- spiritually exhausted,"" Wiley said.",2
"But with Covid's grip lightening, the Trump hangover beginning to subside and Yang's early domination of the headlines evening out",2
voters were beginning to put the candidates under a closer lens.,2
"both of whom unseated incumbent Democrats -- and Tiffany Caban, the leftist political novice who came within a few dozen votes of defeating then-Queens borough president Melinda Katz in a primary to become the county's top prosecutor in 2019",2
told CNN that the progressive mayoral candidates' struggles should not have come as a surprise,2
"Progressives made a lot of strides in New York in the previous two cycles, but there's still work to be done in terms of building out a farm team. ",2
"We've seen districts here and there with compelling candidates, but New York City is a beast.",2
"Plummeting Covid rates and a capital injection from President Joe Biden and Washington Democrats,",2
"have taken the edge off the primary. With fears of a crippling city budget shortfall off the table for now, the race has not been captivated by a single defining issue.",2
The progressive candidates are also campaigning against the city's complicated political history and the challenges posed by an ideologically idiosyncratic electorate.,2
"I wonder how many people in New York identify as progressive, because I can see people who consider themselves progressive going with Yang and (Kathryn) Garcia and some other folks running,"" Hayes said last week",2
"The New York Times delivered its prized endorsement to Garcia, who previously ran the Sanitation Department and has a reputation as a hyper-competent political ""problem-solver",2
New York is also more conservative in certain neighborhoods and demographic groups than outside observers might assume,2
"Before de Blasio won his first term in 2013, it had been more than two decades since a lifelong Democrat was elected mayor.",2
"The city's post-war social democratic experiment, which used an economic boom to pay for a robust social safety net, a free college system and public works projects",2
"By the early 1990s, when Republican Rudy Giuliani took office after ousting incumbent Democrat David Dinkins",2
he capper on Big Business' long push to cement its influence on municipal politics.,2
The last few years have seen a renaissance of progressivism and a backlash against tough-on-crime policies and the real estate lobby,2
"has so far focused more of its energy on pressuring executives, like Cuomo, by electing like-minded legislators than waging moonshot campaigns for mayor or governor.",2
A recent spike in gun violence has also created a more challenging environment for progressive candidates.,2
"Yang condemned calls to ""defund the police"" -- a position only Morales, of his primary rivals, has embraced -- as he and Adams jockey for moderate votes.",2
"Morales acknowledged that there were ""fair concerns"" over her pledge to dramatically scale back the New York Police Department and create civilian first responder units to address nonviolent situations, but insisted that ramping up the police would not solve the problem",2
"There has to be a reclaiming of the definition of public safety, which has for too long been equated with policing, despite the fact that the communities that are most heavily policed are actually often most harmed.""",2
Leftist organizers sit out mayoral race,2
"Despite being widely regarded as the furthest left in the field, Morales did not receive -- nor did she seek",2
the support of the New York City's chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America,2
"The group has proven itself a potent organizing force, but opted to stay out of the mayoral fray and focus on six council races.",2
NYC DSA co-chair Sumathy Kumar told CNN the decision stay on the sidelines of the mayor's race boiled down to a combination of resource management and lack of excitement among DSA members over Stringer,2
"Kumar said the effectiveness of leftist lawmakers at the state level, where Democrats now hold supermajorities in both chambers",2
And that none of the progressives running for mayor fit the bill.,2
"When we're electing people through armies of volunteers, those candidates and those future city council members are going to represent a whole base of people that will be able to active as an opposition to a conservative mayor, if that's what we ended up with,"" Kumar said.",2
"Morales, despite her popularity among young progressives, seemed uncomfortable with the widespread view and description of her campaign as being the furthest left of the lot.",2
"Still, her campaign has picked up steam, and some endorsements from liberal groups, as progressive voters begin to give her and Wiley a second look in the aftermath of the Stringer allegations.",2
"In Brooklyn last week, Zephyr Teachout, the anti-corruption champion who challenged Cuomo in a 2014 primary, announced her support.",2
"""It's a killer combination of all three: incredible joyful vision, incredible history of executive background, and a really strong anti-corruption (policy).""",2
"Supporters, including from the local Sunrise Movement chapter, crowded around as she spoke alongside Teachout",2
"Morales has embraced the youthful energy around her campaign, even if she seemed to view it as a happy accident",2
Missouri governor nixes voter-approved Medicaid expansion plan,2
Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said Thursday that he will not expand Medicaid,2
a change approved by voters and scheduled to start July 1 -- because lawmakers did not appropriate funding,2
"""However, without a revenue source or funding authority from the General Assembly, we are unable to proceed with the expansion at this time and must withdraw our State Plan Amendments to ensure Missouri's existing MO HealthNet program remains solvent.""",2
"He sent a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services withdrawing the state's expansion plan, saying Missouri will resubmit it should funding circumstances change.",2
"Democratic state lawmakers and consumer advocates swiftly responded, saying the courts would force Parson to broaden coverage to low-income residents who make less than roughly $18,000 a year for an individual.",2
"By backtracking on implementation of Medicaid expansion, Gov. Parson is breaking his promise to the people of this state and violating his oath to uphold the Missouri Constitution,""",2
"tweeted state Rep. Crystal Quade, House minority leader. ""Medicaid expansion will still happen as the constitution requires, but because of the governor's dishonorable action, it will take a court order to do it.",2
"We have every confidence that litigation will result in Medicaid expansion beginning on time for the 275,000 Missourians who will be eligible for health care",2
"Missouri became the sixth state to approve Medicaid expansion at the ballot box last August, when voters supported it by 53% to 47%.",2
" In Oklahoma, where voters narrowly approved expansion last June, newly eligible residents can start applying for coverage on June 1. It takes effect the following month.",2
"Expanding Medicaid in Missouri would cost the state $130 million annually, said Amy Blouin, CEO of the left-leaning Missouri Budget Project. ",2
"The federal government, which covers 90% of the cost, would provide the state with $1.7 billion a year.",2
Parson included a $1.9 billion funding request in his budget proposal to the General Assembly.,2
Blouin and other advocates argue that the state has sufficient funding for Medicaid and legislators do not need to appropriate money specifically for the expansion population.,2
"Plus, the American Rescue Plan, which Congress approved in March, offers an incentive for states to expand, which would bring in another $1.1 billion over the next two years, she said.",2
"A Kaiser Family Foundation review of research found that expansion can result in state budget savings by offsetting costs in other areas, reduced uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, and gains in employment.",2
"Other than Missouri and Oklahoma, another 12 states have yet to expand Medicaid. All have Republican governors or GOP-controlled legislatures.",2
"More than 2 million uninsured adults fall into the ""coverage gap,"" meaning their incomes were too high to qualify in their states but too low to make them eligible for Affordable Care Act premium subsidies",2
which are open only to those earning more than 100% of the poverty level in non-expansion states,2
Alabama Legislature votes to legalize medical marijuana,2
"Alabama's State Legislature voted to legalize medical marijuana late Thursday, becoming the most recent state to possibly approve its use amid ongoing talks over revamping cannabis laws.",2
"The measure would create a medical cannabis commission to regulate, license and oversee distribution of medical marijuana",2
The House version of SB 46 passed 68-34 in the chamber with bipartisan support Thursday after a vote on the measure had been blocked by Republicans during a nearly nine-hour debate in the chamber Tuesday night.,2
"The Senate, which initially passed the measure in February, approved of amendments to the legislation made by the House on Thursday night by a 20-9 vote, with one abstention.",2
"We appreciate the debate from the Legislature on the topic,"" Maiola continued. ""This is certainly an emotional issue. We are sensitive to that and will give it the diligence it deserves.",2
The move toward legalizing medical marijuana in the conservative state comes as more state legislatures move to legalize recreational use of marijuana,2
"ncluding another Southern state, Virginia, where marijuana possession will become legal July 1.",2
Mississippi residents voted to create a medical marijuana program during the November election.,2
"Alabama would be the 37th state to approve of medical marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",2
"The House sponsor of the legislation, Republican state Rep. Mike Ball, who had opposed previous medical marijuana measures and said he changed his mind after looking into the medical benefits of it, told CNN the bill could change other people's minds about the state.",2
"He also called for those opposed to the legalization of medical marijuana in the state to ""open your heart, open your mind and listen to the other side.""",2
"Republican state Rep. Rich Wingo, who voted against the bill, told CNN on Thursday that he has fears about how it will be distributed and packaged.",2
"The measure also faces opposition beyond the legislature from 23 Alabama district attorneys, who in April wrote a letter to the State Legislature urging lawmakers to oppose the bill, calling marijuana ""a wolf in sheep's clothing.""",2
"Advocates, however, praised the bill's passage. Melissa Mullins, president of The Alabama Cannabis Coalition and executive administrative assistant of The Alabama Chapter of Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, called it ""a historic day"" for the state.",2
"The latest bill is named the ""Darren Wesley 'Ato' Hall Compassion Act"" after her son who died of AIDS.",2
"In 2019, Ivey signed legislation sponsored by Republican state Sen. ",2
"Tim Melson into law that created a commission to study medical marijuana and extended ""Carly's Law,"" allowing the use of CBD oil to treat children with seizures.",2
"In April, Birmingham Mayor Randall L. Woodfin issued a blanket pardon for more than 15,000 closed marijuana convictions from 1990 to 2020.",2
"Texas moves toward permit-free gun carrying, joining five other states this year pardon for more than 15,000 closed marijuana convictions from 1990 to 2020.",2
A controversial proposal to allow Texans to carry handguns in public without obtaining a license or training passed the state Senate Wednesday,2
"More than a dozen states have introduced measures this year to allow residents to carry guns in public without a license, according to Brady, a gun control advocacy group. ",2
Gun safety advocates said it's not unusual for states to introduce such proposals but said the measures appear to be gaining steam.,2
"So far this year, five states -- Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming -- have passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry. ",2
"The bills are an indication of how conservative lawmakers and gun lobbyists are making inroads at expanding gun rights at the state level, even as lawmakers in Washington debate more gun restrictions.",2
"I think this dynamic that we're seeing is the political pendulum swinging,"" said Shannon Watts",2
"There are some extremist Republican legislatures that are polarized, and they have been more successful and determined really to ignore the will of their constituents.""",2
The Texas Senate passed the bill in an 18-to-13 party line vote after hours of debate on Wednesday. ,2
"The permitless carry bill already passed the Texas House, but the legislation will have to return to the House before a reconciled bill can make its way to the governor's desk.",2
"In Texas, similar permitless carry proposals have stalled in recent years. ",2
"But conservatives, under pressure from the gun lobby, propelled the legislation forward this year over the objection of Democrats, gun control advocates and many law enforcement officials.",2
"Nineteen states allow permitless carry or have laws set to go into effect in the coming months, according to Cassandra Crifasi, the deputy director for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention and Policy, who is currently studying permitless carry policies.",2
"But Texas would be by far the largest state to allow its gun owners to carry their weapons in public without a license, if the bill passes.",2
"Texas already allows citizens to carry rifles openly without a license. But under current Texas law, residents must have a license to carry an open or concealed handgun. ",2
"The state, which has a strong gun culture, counts more than 1.6 million individuals with active licenses to carry, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.",2
"Republican supporters of the permitless carry bill, who often refer to it as ""constitutional carry",2
"have argued that by removing the licensing requirement, they are removing an artificial barrier to residents' right to bear arms and ensuring more Texans have access to personal protection in public.",2
"""This bill, to me, is a restoration of the belief in and trust of our citizens,"" said Texas state Sen. Charles Schwertner, a Republican and the bill's sponsor. ""If you possess a firearm, you should be able to carry a firearm.""",2
But Democrats warned that the bill removes provisions -- from background checks to firearms training -- that help protect the public.,2
"Right now, you're pretty much taking away a lot of the safeguards that we have in place,"" said Texas state Sen. Juan ""Chuy"" Hinojosa, a Democrat. ""We're allowing people who possibly couldn't hit the side of a barn to carry a gun in public.""",2
Democrats and law enforcement officials alike have noted that federal background checks only apply to those buying guns from licensed dealers and the background check in the licensing process was a step in addressing that loophole and weeding out people who should not be carrying guns in public.,2
Roughly 22% of gun owners in the US acquired a recent firearm without a background check,2
"Another study based on prison inmates found that more than 96% of gun offenders, who were legally prohibited from obtaining their weapon, acquired guns from a supplier that was not required to conduct a background check.",2
Schwertner noted that Texans would still be personally responsible for learning to handle their weapons and said other federal and state laws dictate who is prohibited from carrying a weapon.,2
"On guns, lawmakers at odds with constituents",2
"While GOP lawmakers in Texas have jumped on board with the permitless proposal, voters don't share their sentiments. ",2
"A majority -- 59% -- of Texas voters said they opposed unlicensed carry, according to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll released Monday.",2
"Some 56% of Republicans said unlicensed carry should be allowed. Meantime, 85% of Democrats opposed it.",2
"""The thing that's alarming about it is there's still certain states -- and Texas has long been one -- where effectively the gun industry controls the agenda, not the people,"" said Brady president Kris Brown. ""That is very concerning.""",2
Texas law enforcement officers and gun violence experts alike expressed concerns that the proposed legislation would make it more difficult to determine who was unlawfully carrying a weapon and create additional stresses in interactions between the public and police.,2
"""If law enforcement has no way of easily determining whether you're allowed to carry that gun around in public, that can create stressful and potentially dangerous situations,"" Crifasi, the permitless carry researcher, said. ",2
"Hunt, of the Houston Police Officers' Union, said many officers are ""very conservative folks"" and are strong believers in Texans' Second Amendment rights.",2
"Under current law, Hunt said, it's easy to look at someone's gun license and determine whether they are legally carrying. ",2
FEMA's Covid funeral assistance program is up and running after a rocky start.,2
US infection rate hits 7-month low as vaccinations rise,2
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved more than 2,585 applications for newly available Covid-19 funeral assistance in the first month after the program launched -- but there are many more people waiting for help.",2
"The agency received nearly 176,000 applications from those who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus as of May 11, FEMA said",2

"he Justice Department's criminal investigation into Rudy Giuliani involves an international cast of characters: Trump White House allies, Republican lawyers, Ukrainian oligarchs, diplomats, right-wing journalists and other figures who aren't household names.",2
"The probe burst into public view last week when authorities raided Giuliani's home and office in New York City, where he was mayor two decades ago. Investigators were armed with a search warrant that Giuliani's lawyer said mentioned an investigation into potentially illegal foreign lobbying.",2
"Giuliani has denied all wrongdoing and claimed the investigation itself is unconstitutional, and he said on Fox News last week that the ""Department of Injustice"" should be ""investigated for blatantly violating my constitutional rights.""",2
Key player in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.,2
"Met with Ukrainians and brokered meetings between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials, who were pressured to help Trump's reelection bid by spreading conspiracies about candidate Joe Biden",2
Publicly flipped on Trump and Giuliani and implicated them in the anti-Biden schemes in Ukraine. Assisted House Democrats with their impeachment inquiry against Trump in 2019.,2
"Worked closely with Parnas and Giuliani to dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine, and attended some of the meetings with the Ukrainians.",2
"As vice president, Biden pressured Poroshenko to fire Shokin, citing Shokin's unwillingness to crack down on corruption. This view was shared by many other Western leaders.",2
"Ukraine's top prosecutor from 2015 to 2016, under then-President Petro Poroshenko.",2
He later allied with Giuliani to spread false claims of corruption against Biden. He met with Giuliani in Kiev and promoted false claims in a propaganda-style documentary aired by the pro-Trump outlet OANN.,2
US officials later testified that the opposite was true -- Shokin was fired for not doing enough to investigate corruption.,2
"According to House Democrats' impeachment report, Shokin hired Republican lawyers Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova ""for the purpose of collecting evidence"" about Biden's role in his firing ""and presenting such evidence to U.S. and foreign authorities."" The retainer was for $25,000 per month, according to The New York Times.",2
Ex-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko succeeded Shokin as Ukraine's top prosecutor. Was a close Poroshenko ally.,2
"Ex-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko participated in the OANN documentary, where he promoted many of the debunked allegations about the Biden family. He gave interviews to right-wing columnist John Solomon, who repeated the same anti-Biden and pro-Trump conspiracies.",2
"He hired Toensing and diGenova to represent him ""in meetings with U.S. officials regarding alleged 'evidence' of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,"" according to a retainer agreement cited in the House Democrats' impeachment report. The alleged Ukrainian meddling is actually a pro-Trump conspiracy theory that denies Russian meddling.",2
"Along with Lutsenko, he hired Toensing and diGenova to represent him ""in meetings with US officials"" about supposed Ukrainian meddling in 2016.",2
House Republicans vote to make Elise Stefanik conference chair replacing Liz Cheney,2
"House Republicans voted on Friday to elevate Rep. Elise Stefanik to the No. 3 leadership position of conference chair after ousting Rep. Liz Cheney from the role because she repeatedly called out former President Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" that the 2020 election was stolen.",2
"Stefanik, a high-profile Trump defender, faced a conservative challenger -- GOP Rep. Chip Roy -- but his candidacy was viewed as a long-shot, and the New York congresswoman had the backing of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Trump. ",2
"""House Republicans are united in our focus to fight on behalf of the American people to save our country from the radical Socialist Democrat agenda,"" she said.",2
Stefanik's rise within the ranks of House GOP leadership and Cheney's removal starkly underscores the Republican Party's entrenched loyalty to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent even after Trump's election lies incited a deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6.,2
"Amid Trump's false claims over voter fraud, Stefanik supported an objection during the Electoral College vote count to affirm President Joe Biden's win. ",2
Trump stood by Stefanik in her run for the leadership post and weighed in on Roy's late entry into the race Thursday evening with a statement slamming the congressman and reiterating his support for the congresswoman.,2
Stefanik has made a pitch to House Republicans that she will help deliver on a message of unity and united opposition to Democrats in Congress and in the White House as the party works to win back the House majority in 2022.,2
"McCarthy congratulated Stefanik on her election at a news conference after the vote, before pivoting to criticism of Democrats.",2
Stefanik did face pushback from some conservative House Republicans in her bid for leadership.,2
The congresswoman represents a district that pivoted in the past from voting for former President Barack Obama to Trump and she has long been known on Capitol Hill as a more moderate Republican.,2
"In 2015, 2016 and the early days of his term in office, she criticized Trump on a range of issues from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions, such as overhauling NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia.",2
"When House Democrats moved to impeach Trump for the first time in 2019, however, Stefanik emerged as one of the President's most outspoken defenders, taking on Democrats and earning Trump's praise as ""a new Republican star.""",2
"on the other hand, is known as a more conservative Republican, but she has also become a major Trump critic. ",2
House Republicans formally ousted Cheney from her leadership post in a voice vote on Wednesday. ,2
"Before the vote, the Wyoming Republican called out Trump and other Republicans who aided his efforts to overturn his loss and warned, ""we cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.""",2
"Stefanik said Wednesday afternoon she ""absolutely"" has enough votes to secure her election to the position, even if someone else decides to jump in the race. Roy publicly announced his intention to run Thursday.",2
"The House Freedom Caucus, a group of Trump-aligned far-right Republicans held a forum with Stefanik on Wednesday evening, which the New York congresswoman called ""a great conversation"" after it concluded.",2
Stefanik also met this week with the conservative Republican Study Committee in her efforts to win over the conference. ,2
"Stefanik has signaled to some colleagues that she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks, an assurance that could help assuage concerns from any lawmakers reluctant to support her.",2
