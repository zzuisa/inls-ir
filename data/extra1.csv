Biden issues warning to gas station owners on price gouging,2
"The company said its team ""worked safely and tirelessly around the clock"" to restore operations and thanked the White House, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, the FBI and other government agencies for their support",2
Republican governors are refusing aid from Democrats in Washington,2
Democrats in Washington have approved trillions of dollars to help Americans weather the coronavirus pandemic,2
 but Republican state officials are pulling back relief for low-income Americans by turning away federal money,2
17 governors have announced they'll be cutting off pandemic unemployment benefits early,2
The moves echo the refusal by GOP-led states to participate in Medicaid expansion under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act,2
 his state would not implement a voter-approved Medicaid expansion on July 1 for budget reasons.,2
He and other Republican officials in the dozen red-led states ,2
 to expand Medicaid aren't stepping up to take advantage of a big sweetener that Democrats included in their recent $1.9 trillion relief package,2
While Republicans in Washington focus on ridding the party of leaders perceived as disloyal to former President Donald Trump,2
GOP governors are leaning into the longstanding party orthodoxy of advocating for paychecks instead of government handouts,2
 his state would cease the federal benefits on June 26,2
the governors who are terminating the programs say that the more generous payments,2
Ending pandemic unemployment benefits early,2
"What was intended to be a short-term financial assistance for the vulnerable and displaced during the height of the pandemic has turned into a dangerous federal entitlement, incentivizing and paying workers to stay at home rather than encouraging them to return to the workplace",2
who announced last week that the programs would end on June 30 in his state,2
"Democrats, who recently extended the expansion until early September as part of their $1.9 million coronavirus relief package",2
defend the continued need for enhanced benefits,2
The House GOP's move to remove Rep. Liz Cheney from her leadership position is widely seen as the latest move to placate the base at the risk of alienating the center of the electorate,2
 Cheney had voted to impeach former President Donald Trump and has continued her critiques of him while most other Republicans seem to have a hard time distancing themselves from him,2
But a look at the statistics reveals that Republicans may be playing it right when it comes to Trump,2
The belief that Republicans should not try to placate Trump or his supporters comes down to the fact that he is unpopular and just lost a presidential election,2
there's little sign that Trump is even on the minds' of most voters these days,2
there's not much of a sign that the GOP's association with Trump is hurting them at this point,2
Take a look at the generic congressional ballot,2
Democrats hold a slight lead of about 3 to 4 points in an average of polls,2
Trump lost the 2020 election by 4.5 points,2
 House Republicans lost nationally by 3.1 points,2
Republicans are in no worse position than they were in the 2020 election,2
they're actually polling better now on the generic ballot than they were heading into the last election by about 3 to 4 points because polling across the board underestimated Republicans,2
If Republicans were underperforming their baseline,2
 you'd expect them to be doing worse than what President Joe Biden's approval ratings would suggest,2
 Biden's net approval rating (approval - disapproval) among voters is just north of +10 point,2
which is actually more than double the Democrats' advantage on the generic ballot,2
"Comparing the results in those elections to the 2020 presidential election in those districts, we see that there hasn't been much movement on the whole",2
Examining all special elections where at least one Democrat and one Republican ran,2
Republicans are outperforming their 2020 baseline by 3 points on average,2
Not counting those elections with multiple Democrats or Republicans running,2
"with a major independent candidate, Republicans are matching their 2020 position",2
Keep in mind that even a small tick toward the Republicans would have resulted in a very different outcome in 2020,2
 Biden won the state that put him over the top in the Electoral College (Wisconsin) by less than a point,2
Republicans were just 5 seats away from getting a House majority and a mere 1 seat from earning a Senate majority,2
Republicans only need their 2020 base and a little more,2
"If Republicans detach themselves from Trump too much, they risk alienating Trump and many of his voters",2
We know from Pew Research Center polling that a majority of Republicans don't want the party to be accepting of elected officials who openly criticize him,2
We also know from the Pew polling that nearly two-thirds of Republicans don't want the party to be accepting of elected officials who voted to impeach Trump,2
"In the lead up to the 2021 Georgia Senate runoff elections, Trump had sought to falsely cast doubts on the ability of the state to accurately count votes",2
The result was dampened Republican turnout,2
Republican Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene's heavily Republican congressional district saw the largest dropoff in votes cast of any congressional district from the 2020 general election,2
"As we head into the 2022 elections, it's not difficult to see Trump pulling similar shenanigans as he did in Georgia",2
"He owes the party nothing, and he has nothing to lose",2
The best case scenario for Republicans is to turn out his voters,2
while trying to keep Trump out of the limelight,2
 Officer on people who spread lies about Capitol riot,2
"media outlets can access videos used in Capitol riot court cases after 15 news outlets, including CNN, sought body camera and surveillance video that's been seen by judges but not the public",2
 Republicans and former President Donald Trump try to recast the January 6 hijacking of the US Capitol by Trump supporters as victimization of the far right,2
Howell didn't side with a blanket public access policy,2
She also noted that releasing all video from court proceedings before a trial could prejudice future juries,2
"So the news outlets will have to seek video from court on a case-by-case basis, Howell wrote in an opinion released Friday",2
"So far, Justice Department prosecutors have used videos to illustrate what they say are the most dangerous defendants' actions on January 6, especially in cases where Trump supporters assaulted police",2
"One Metropolitan Police officer who was beaten and tased during the riot, Michael Fanone, has advocated for the release of his body camera video and repeatedly criticized Republicans who've tried to downplay the violence during the insurrection",2
Arizona Republicans move 2020 ballots in trucks after pausing controversial election audit,2
 the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump,2
the place where the ballots are stored will be in a condition that does not affect the ballots negatively,2
That pace would require an exponential ramp-up and rate that so far have proved elusive to this partisan ballot count,2
taking place despite two audits conducted by Maricopa County showing no widespread election fraud,2
 there were bumper stickers signaling support for Trump,2
"Elouise Flagg, one of the workers, said she was inspired to join the Cyber Ninjas ballot count because she didn't believe the results of the 2020 election nor the subsequent audits conducted by Maricopa County",2
I think Donald Trump won the election -- firm believer,2
No 'civil war' here,2
Republicans are at peace in their embrace of Trump,2
"(CNN)It was the bureaucratic shuffle ""heard round the world.""",2
"House Republicans booted Rep. Liz Cheney from their leadership trio this week, replacing the Wyoming conservative with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York",2
"the shape-shifting former Paul Ryan acolyte-turned-Trump-booster who, as recently as five years ago, could barely bring herself to speak the 2016 GOP nominee's name",2
Cheney's defenestration and Stefanik's subsequent ascent were an anticlimax,2
not just because the switch-a-roo had been choreographed for weeks,2
unites Republican lawmakers in Congress and many powerful positions around the country,2
former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election are gospel,2
"After the dust settled on Friday, House Republicans sounded eager to move on from this particular headline-grabbing melodrama",2
the party would be free to focus on opposing the Democratic agenda and winning congressional majorities in next year's midterm elections,2
"Those imperatives, as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy views it, were being frustrated by Cheney's refusal to parrot the party line",2
"If the Cheney episode is instructive in any meaningful, lasting way, it should be to make clear that the so-called ""GOP civil war"" is anything",2
The Trumpist forces are on the march,2
 in Congress and state capitols where voting rights are being rolled back as part of a growing suppression regime,2
"Cheney's resistance, for all its sound and fury, attracted no new public support from Republican ranks",2
"Instead, it provided yet another platform for Trump loyalists to assert their dominance over the party -- and its future",2
"For her part, Stefanik marched out to put a bow on the episode, declaring that House Republicans ""are unified in working with President Trump.""",2
"The remark, in the context of what had unfolded over the previous few days, prompted some understandable eye-rolling",2
Republicans are not only in near-perfect lockstep with Trump -- who celebrated Stefanik's promotion -- but also with the politics of Trumpism,2
a more potent threat to the basic functions of American democracy than the former President himself,2
Trumpism without Trump,2
"In a Friday evening interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""The Lead,"" Cheney side-stepped the question of Republican unity and criticized the Biden administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, before explaining her concerns over the party's credibility with voters",2
"""We've got to be able to tell people you can trust us,"" she said",2
" ""and trust us to be based around conservative principles and reject the lie and to protect the Constitution.""",2
"That her replacement, Stefanik, is by any measure a less conservative legislator than Cheney ",2
underscored the GOP's clear shift from a more traditional right-wing ideological bearing to a full embrace of Trumpism's particular demands,2
 the leaders of the anti-Trump chorus can be divided roughly into two camps: those long-retired from politics and others,2
"former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who said their piece before standing down to avoid serious tests of their political mettle",2
"A third bucket exists mostly in the states, where GOP officials -- including those, like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who blocked Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election result",2
"using ginned-up concerns over ""election integrity,"" sowed last November, as a basis to back restrictive new voting laws",2
"Asked in March why he supported the legislation, given his own insistence that the last election had been fairly decided",2
Raffensperger drew a false equivalence between 2018 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' protests over the administration of that election and Trump's actions last year,2
" After conflating the two, Raffensperger claimed that the sum effect was a ""shot to the confidence of voters"" that needed a remedy",2
"In her interview with Tapper on Friday, Cheney described Raffensperger as a ""really good example of the tremendous strength of local Republican officials around the country refusing to give in when President Trump was trying to pressure them.""",2
"""Our system held,"" Cheney continued, ""the institutions held and there's an ongoing danger and we need to stand up against it.""",2
That Raffensperger didn't bend to Trump's will is to his credit,2
"hat he is now parlaying that credibility to give cover to a new, more subtle form of illiberalism in his home state underscores how deep the rot goes ",2
" and that whether Trump runs again in 2024 or not, the Republican Party is more than happy to walk through the door he busted open",2
Rep. Claudia Tenney offered up a similar kind of misdirection this week as she tried to squirm out of a question about Trump's post-campaign disinformation offensive.,2
"As anti-democratic dissembling goes, Tenney's existential journey might seem mild",2
"But it is, in many ways, the most dangerous kind",2
"The loudest voices might get the most attention, but it is the measured ones, when peddling an outright lie about a free and fair election, that do the most to internalize the deception",2
" And they are not, as some apologists are quick to suggest, simply acting out of a fear of backlash from Trump's supporters.",2
"""Each day spent re-litigating the past is one less day we have to seize the future,"" the minority leader had written in a letter to his members before they voted on Cheney's fate",2
"If we are to succeed in stopping the radical Democrat agenda from destroying our country, these internal conflicts need to be resolved so as not to detract from the efforts of our collective team",2
"Tempting though it might be to dismiss Greene as a back-bencher with little influence on much of anything that takes place at her day job, she is, for all the mess, a rather neat encapsulation of both Trump's power and its limits.",2
"Though she is a political disciple of the former President, she is hardly taking orders from him.",2
"Greene is the unfettered id of the Republican Party in 2021, a sideshow character who feeds on confrontation and a scorn for Democrats and the basic function of government.",2
"That kind of political nihilism, and the popular support that delivered it to Congress, cannot be reasoned away.",2
"And it is there that Cheney's high-minded rhetoric, ultimately, falls short, along with Democrats' appeals to decency",2
 Greene is not susceptible to it and Republicans -- even the more performatively mainstream among them -- have no interest in rooting out the Trumpists now filling their ranks,2
Multiple crises at home and abroad provide a reality check for Biden's White House,2
"violence would begin rapidly escalating between Israelis and Palestinians, lighting up telephone lines between Washington and the Middle East and thrusting Biden back into a conflict riddled with failed US efforts at brokering peace",2
"White House officials had been anticipating the CDC would soon make changes, but many believed it would take the notoriously slow-moving agency until later this month to decide on the new recommendations",2
Biden had mostly been spared the types of quickly spiraling foreign crises or surprise domestic emergencies that compose any presidency,2
" His plate has instead been filled with longer-term issues -- like recovering from the pandemic -- or tenacious problems, like a surge of migrants at the Southwestern border",2
"Publicly, the White House assumed a calm demeanor toward the developments, even as concerns about the potential political fallout pervaded.",2
Biden saw firsthand how President Barack Obama strove to manage the political fallout from the BP oil spill in the early days of his presidency,2
"After his initial briefing on the hack last Saturday at Camp David, Biden asked for updates every day by members of his staff",2
"Republicans seized the opportunity to compare Biden to Carter, even though the pipeline shutdown was prompted by Russia-based ransomware hackers who penetrated a weak private-sector network",2
"""This is a whole-of-government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it's needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers,"" he said from the Roosevelt Room",2
"aking credit for ""extraordinary measures"" that would provide enough gas to fill the tanks of 5 million vehicles.",2
Biden suggested Thursday that he wasn't ruling out a counterattack on the criminal syndicate responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack,2
"We're also going to pursue a measure to disrupt their ability to operate.""",2
The President said he'd raise the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit,2
Attention turns back to the Middle East,2
"The episode seemed to confirm Biden's belief that areas like cybersecurity, Russia and China present today's most serious foreign threats.",2
Yet an urgent foreign crisis in the Middle East has occupied much of the national security attention at the White House this week,2
Those conversations come amid the heightened concern about civilian causalities in Gaza.,2
"A White House official told CNN earlier in the day that internal meetings would be held Saturday on the escalating violence, as well as on the administration's infrastructure push",2
"At the State Department, the Pentagon and the office suite of the National Security Council, a flurry of telephone calls had gone out to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, along with officials in Egypt and Qatar who the US hopes can help broker a ceasefire.",2
"Amid the chaos, he spoke publicly about the violence only when questioned by reporters.",2
"Though he has been versed on this issue for decades as a lawmaker leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as vice president, a growing strain of Democratic politics has been harshly critical of Israel's actions.",2
"""blanket statements"" like Biden's ""dehumanize Palestinians & imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations.""",2
Biden and the White House have shown little willingness to bend to that pressure. ,2
"And over the course of the week, he focused far more public attention on domestic matters, including the still-fragile economy",2
"""We are in the midst of restarting this economy in earnest, and we are making good progress in doing so. However, we must keep in mind that an economy will not heal instantaneously,",2
The White House downplayed inflation concerns by saying the new data reflects pent-up consumer demand that some suppliers cannot immediately meet.,2
"""Policymakers at the Fed and in the (White House) need to recognize that the risk of a Vietnam inflation scenario is now greater than the deflation risks on which they were originally focused,""",2
"used his hastily arranged Rose Garden remarks to reflect upon the larger trajectory of the pandemic: its sorrows, its politics and ultimately its conclusion.",2
Cheney says some GOP members voted against impeachment out of fear for their lives,2
"Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whose criticism of former President Donald Trump led to her ouster from House Republican leadership",2
"Telling CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead"" that there are ""more members who believe in substance and policy and ideals than are willing to say so,""",2
"""If you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security -- afraid, in some instances, for their lives,""",2
"""And that tells you something about where we are as a country, that members of Congress aren't able to cast votes, or feel that they can't, because of their own security.""",2
"Stefanik has supported Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election while Cheney has repeatedly rebutted them,",2
 leading House Republicans to complain that the Wyoming Republican is undermining the party's message of promoting Trump's brand of politics.,2
"Cheney said her role as a member of Congress obligated her to oppose the widespread lie of fraud in the election and she believes that ""we've had a collapse of truth in this country.""",2
"""We've seen an evolution of, you know, a general situation where conspiracy theories are rampant, where good people in a lot of instances have been misled and believe things that are not true,""",2
"""And so, I think that we all have an obligation to make sure we're doing everything we can to convey the truth, to stand for the truth and to stand for the Constitution and our obligations.""",2
"Trump and his lies seeking to undermine the federal election system are an ""ongoing danger"" to the country, Cheney said.",2
"""He may try, but he won't succeed,"" she said when asked if she thought Trump would try in 2024 to purge from the party people like her and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger",2
"""the role individuals have to play in defending the system, and how important that is -- our system held, the institutions held",2
"There's an ongoing danger and we've got to continue to stand up against it.""",2
"""I think it's important for us to have people in leadership who are conservative and I think it's also really important for us to have people in leadership who are committed to the truth and committed to the Constitution,""",2
"Cheney was asked what it means for the Republican Party to have replaced her with Stefanik, who has promoted Trump's falsehoods about the election.",2
Cheney also told ABC News that she regrets voting for Trump in 2020.,2
Stimulus checks and pandemic aid make it even more important to file a 2020 tax return,2
There are some people who might not be required to file a tax return but are eligible for a refund if they qualify for the child tax credit.,2
"More workers without children will qualify for the earned income tax credit for 2021, and the maximum amount they can receive will nearly triple",2
"The relief package also beefed up the child and dependent care tax credit to cover half of care costs up to $4,000 for one child or dependent and $8,000 for two or more children or dependents",2
The current drama in the GOP is the latest and most concrete evidence that the party is undergoing a very painful evolution.,2
"Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of a former vice president and a power in her own right, was excised from House leadership because she would not stop criticizing former President Donald Trump's continued lying about his 2020 election loss.",2
Republicans under Trump became the party that appealed to White supremacists and made protecting Confederate statues a campaign issue.,2
"Once the party specifically pushing the importance of the Constitution and the rule of law, it is now unacceptable for party leaders like Cheney to do anything but tolerate the attempted overthrow of valid election results",2
 The result is that a major US political party is now wedded completely to an anti-democratic ideology.,2
"""I don't think a third party necessarily works in the kind of political system we have,"" Conway told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night",2
"""But there is a need for people who have a conservative to moderate point of view and want to believe in the rule of law and they need a place to go and a place where they can organize and support candidates that are consistent with that.""",2
The split between Republicans willing to stand for the truth and those happy to accept its attempted overthrow does not necessarily signify a complete reorienting of US parties,2
"Early on, Federalist supporters of a stronger national government opposed Democratic-Republican defenders of the primacy of states.",2
"Opposition to adding slave states in the West largely created the Republicans, who later faced splintering of their own with Bull Moose Progressives led by Theodore Roosevelt, who was frustrated at the direction his party took after he left the White House and was worried about ties between business and politics.",2
what largely separates Democrats and Republicans is how involved the government should be in guaranteeing racial and economic equality.,2
Parties change because the country changes,2
" the Sun Belt states, most of which leaned solidly Republican until recently, are likely to grow more competitive, even as their clout in the House and Electoral College steadily increases.""",2
the party has for decades actively appealed to White Americans and religious conservatives.,2
"That has not changed, even if Trump has crossed a line by adding an anti-democratic paranoia to the mix",2
"The existing two-party system, as limited as it seems to anyone who wants more than a binary choice on Election Day, is still better than a one-party system -- which inevitably becomes autocracy.",2
"""Without this clash of parties we don't have a capacity to move forward,"" said the author Jon Meacham during an appearance on CNN last week.",2
House Democrats on Friday introduced a $1.9 billion spending bill to increase security at the US Capitol in response to the deadly January 6 attack by a violent pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.,2
" covers a wide array of priorities, including providing funding to broadly enhance security across Capitol grounds",2
"specific provisions to bolster protections and increase preparedness for lawmakers, including at their district offices, and the Capitol Police force.",2
Democrats have pushed for security upgrades and a supplemental funding bill to address security at the Capitol in the wake of the January 6 attack incited by former President Donald Trump's lies ,2
" Some Republicans have warned, however, against an overreach that they say would effectively create a locked down Capitol.",2
"""This emergency supplemental appropriation addresses the direct costs of the insurrection and strengthens Capitol security for the future,",2
" ""It is also long overdue recognition of the work of the Capitol Police, the sacrifices that they and their families have made, and the changes they need.""",2
There would be $162.7 million to harden security safeguards for windows and doors at the Capitol building as well as at House and Senate office buildings.,2
"The General Services Administration has provided House Democrats with documents related to former President Donald Trump's Washington hotel, in the second case this week where the Biden administration gave the House information that the Trump administration had blocked it from obtaining.",2
"House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, requested a slew of records in March related to the Trump International Hotel lease of the Old Post Office Building,",2
"White House officials said they were surprised when the CDC informed them at about 9 p.m. ET Wednesday that the agency was changing its guidance for fully vaccinated people, CNN reported",2
"Changes to masking rules on federal property are likely coming soon, the White House said Friday, after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that Americans who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear masks outdoors or indoors except under rare certain circumstances",2
"""It may take a couple of days, but certainly I would expect on federal lands, federal properties that the (CDC) guidelines will be the guide,"" ",2
The federal mandate Biden signed on his first day in office affects federal offices and federal lands,2
" Officials had not expected the CDC to release new masking guidance for at least several more days, and also did not anticipate how far-reaching the guidance would be, given the CDC's cautious track record.",2
