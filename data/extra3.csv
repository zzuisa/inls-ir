President Joe Biden said Thursday he does not believe the Russian government was behind a cyberattack that shut down the pipeline supplying gasoline to the eastern US but said Moscow must do more to stop such attacks coming from Russia.,2
"When asked directly if he would rule out any sort of cyberattacks targeting the criminal group that carried out the attack, Biden simply said, ""No.""",2
Speaking from the White House's Roosevelt Room Thursday afternoon,2
the President provided an update on the Colonial Pipeline incident,2
seeking to assure the American people that his administration is mitigating gas shortages in the Southeast and protecting Americans from price gouging in the aftermath of the shutdown,2
"""We do not believe -- emphasize, we do not believe -- the Russian government was involved in this attack,"" Biden said",2
But we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia,2
Moscow bears a responsibility to stop such attacks when they originate within its borders,2
We have been in direct communications with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,2
"while engaging federal agencies and a third-party cybersecurity firm, FireEye, to investigate the attack",2
The attack on the critical pipeline highlighted growing concerns over the vulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastructure,2
"DarkSide, is a criminal syndicate believed to be based in Russia",2
Cyber experts have said it operates with the tacit permission from Moscow,2
though isn't controlled by the government,2
Biden said he planned to raise the topic of cyberattacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit,2
"and suggested world leaders were working to develop an ""international standard"" where governments will prosecute hacking networks operating within their borders",2
He said he was confident Putin himself had not directed the pipeline attack,2
I am confident that I read the report of the FBI accurately and they say they were not,2
But he would not rule out taking cyber countermeasures to prevent future attacks from the criminal group,2
Biden signed an executive order Wednesday meant to better secure the nation from cyberattacks,2
the White House acknowledged more will need to be done to prevent the type of hack that impacted the Colonial Pipeline,2
The US has accused Russia of meddling in the 2020 US election and the country's foreign intelligence service of being behind the SolarWinds intrusion campaign last year that compromised nine US agencies and dozens of private organizations,2
The Biden administration last month targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions in response,2
Active-duty Marine charged with assaulting police officers at US Capitol riot,2
An active-duty US Marine was arrested Thursday for allegedly participating in the deadly Capitol insurrection and charged with assaulting multiple police officers inside and outside the iconic building during the attack,2
according to the Justice Department,2
"Warnagiris is charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers",2
obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder,2
the Pentagon confirmed,2
Other current or former service members were previously charged in connection with the January 6 attack at the Capitol,2
according to a CNN review of court documents and Pentagon records,2
federal prosecutors also charged a member of the Wisconsin National Guard with four federal crimes,2
The Justice Department says Warnagiris' actions were caught on video posted to YouTube and that he pushed through a line of police officers guarding the East Rotunda doors on January 6,2
Prosecutors say Warnagiris resisted when a US Capitol Police officer tried to pull the doors shut,2
"The FBI had been seeking Warnagiris' identity, posting his photo among hundreds of others on its website",2
The Justice Department said in charging documents that a member of the public who worked with Warnagiris in 2019 had identified him to the FBI,2
The US Marine Corps confirmed Warnagiris' status as an active-duty Marine and said in a statement that it condemns,2
racial hatred or extremism in the Marine Corps,2
Bigotry and racial extremism run contrary to our core values,2
"Participation with hate or extremist groups of any kind is directly contradictory to the core values of honor, courage, and commitment that we stand for as Marines and isn't tolerated by the Marine Corps",2
Warnagiris made an initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and will have a preliminary hearing in Washington once he hires an attorney,2
At least 400 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot,2
according to a CNN review of court documents,2
"There are hundreds of still-unidentified photographs of rioters on the FBI's ""most wanted"" website",2
The deadly attack injured more than 100 police officers,2
halted Congress' counting of the Electoral College votes for more than five hours and forced lawmakers into lockdown when pro-Trump rioters overran the US Capitol Police,2
We just witnessed another major turning point in US political history,2
Wednesday's ouster of Rep. Liz Cheney from the House Republican leadership is more important as a symbolic move for Republicans as they embrace Trumpism than it is for the specific action of replacing a third-ranking lawmaker in the party's congressional leadership structure,2
at or near the top of Republican leadership since the 1970s,2
Dick Cheney started working in Richard Nixon's White House as an intern and was appointed White House chief of staff under Gerald Ford,2
and minority whip during the Ronald Reagan administration and then was Secretary of Defense during the George H.W. Bush administration,2
The election of Donald Trump was itself a refutation of previous Republican administrations,2
but the excision of Cheney is a sign that the party has moved on from the beacon-of-freedom ideals that dominated the party for decades,2
the GOP pushed democracy as gospel with words,2
"Cheney referenced that lineage when she spoke, defiantly, on the House floor Tuesday night",2
"As the party of Reagan, Republicans championed democracy, won the Cold War, and defeated the Soviet Communists",2
"As we speak, America is on the cusp of another Cold War this time with communist China",2
Attacks against our democratic process and the rule of law empower our adversaries and feed Communist propaganda that American democracy is a failure,2
"Our election was not stolen, and America has not failed",2
a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom,2
if your party is devoted to rejecting the results of a free and fair election,2
"It's completely impossible to be that beacon when Republicans in Arizona have squirreled some of the state's 2020 ballots behind closed doors, hunting for fraud that does not exist and creating a circus of democracy",2
Biden administration expands effort to identify vulnerable migrant families in Mexico for entry into US,2
The Biden administration plans to coordinate with nongovernmental organizations to identify vulnerable migrant families in Mexico and allow them to enter the United States,2
instead of turning them away under a Trump-era border policy,2
The administration has been facing fierce criticism for relying on a public health authority,2
that was put in place under the Trump administration in early 2020 at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic,2
The policy allows border officials to expel migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border,2
Immigrant advocates argue it has put migrants in harm's way,2
since unaccompanied migrant children are not subject to the policy,2
"concerned about the continuation of Title 42, that policy that the Trump administration used to expel migrants across the board, including children and families desperately attempting to come here for our asylum process",2
The administration's move appears designed to quell those concerns by addressing more families who are deemed exceptions to the policy,2
As the United States continue?s to enforce the CDC Order under its Title 42 public health authority,2
we are working to streamline a system for identifying and lawfully processing particularly vulnerable individuals who warrant humanitarian exceptions under the order,2
This humanitarian exception process involves close coordination with international and non-governmental organizations in Mexico and COVID-19 testing before those identified through this process are allowed to enter the country,2
The public health order remains the subject of litigation,2
Some exceptions have been made to the policy,2
plaintiffs in a case concerning families being subject to the order have been in negotiations with the government,2
including exempting 35 families daily who are referred by the American Civil Liberties Union to be admitted to the United States,2
The Title 42 order has always had an humanitarian exemption for especially vulnerable individuals and it is critical that the exemption process work efficiently through the ACLU process and the new consortium of global NGOs,2
"The approach is similar to one taken by the administration earlier this year to process migrants who had been subject to the ""remain in Mexico"" policy.",2
That Trump-era policy forced asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their immigration court dates in the US,2
The administration has similarly collaborated with international organizations to help identify and process thousands of migrants into the US with active cases under that policy,2
Migrants processed through that program are tested for the coronavirus before being allowed entry into the United States,2
Administration to invest $7.4 billion to hire and train public health workers to respond to pandemic,2
The Biden administration will invest $7.4 billion to recruit and hire public health workers to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for future public health challenges,2
the White House announced Thursday,2
"The funding includes $4.4 billion to expand public health staffing for the Covid-19 response and support vaccination outreach, contact tracing and outbreak investigations",2
It will also invest $3 billion to prepare for future pandemics and create a new program to modernize the public health workforce,2
The funding announced today will allow the United States to expand its public health workforce,2
"creating tens of thousands of jobs to support vaccinations, testing, contact tracing, and community outreach, and strengthen America's future public health infrastructure",2
the White House said in a fact sheet,2
The announcement comes as more than 117.6 million people are fully vaccinated,2
according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,2
and as the Biden administration races to get the remaining portion of the population their shots,2
The administration is also looking toward the future and will use part of the funds announced on Thursday to launch the Public Health AmeriCorps to recruit and build out a new workforce to respond to the country's future public health needs,2
The CDC will increase funding for programs like the Epidemic Intelligence Service,2
the Undergraduate Public Health Scholars Program and a fellowship that offers students from underrepresented backgrounds the opportunity to study infectious diseases and health disparities,2
The federal health agency will use the funds to expand existing public health laboratory fellowship programs for laboratory science graduates and also implement a new public health internship program to allow undergraduate students to gain experience in public health laboratory settings,2
The CDC will also create a new grant program to provide health departments that do not have sufficient resources with support so they can hire staff and allow those who were hired for the Covid-19 pandemic to continue their careers as public health professionals,2
have said that it is imperative the US and other nations invest in public health infrastructure,2
The sad truth is that pandemics even deadlier than Covid could happen at any point in the future,2
"Failure is an option, but success is possible. We must work together as a world and invest the financial and political capital",2
Biden won't rule out a retaliatory cyberattack on group responsible for pipeline hack and says Russia isn't to blame,2
President Joe Biden said Thursday he does not believe the Russian government was behind a cyberattack that shut down the pipeline supplying gasoline to the eastern US but said Moscow must do more to stop such attacks coming from Russia,2
When asked directly if he would rule out any sort of cyberattacks targeting the criminal group that carried out the attack,2
Biden simply said,2
Speaking from the White House's Roosevelt Room Thursday afternoon,2
"the President provided an update on the Colonial Pipeline incident, seeking to assure the American people that his administration is mitigating gas shortages in the Southeast and protecting Americans from price gouging in the aftermath of the shutdown",2

But we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia,2
"Moscow bears a responsibility to stop such attacks when they originate within its borders, the President added",2
We have been in direct communications with Moscow about the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,2
while engaging federal agencies and a third-party cybersecurity firm,2
The attack on the critical pipeline highlighted growing concerns over the vulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastructure,2
"with recent targets as varied as state and local governments, hospitals and police departments",2
is a criminal syndicate believed to be based in Russia,2
Cyber experts have said it operates with the tacit permission from Moscow,2
though isn't controlled by the government,2
Biden said he planned to raise the topic of cyberattacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit,2

The Biden administration last month targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions in response,2
Alarm bells ringing in the White House over economy as Biden faces new headwinds,2
Alarming economic numbers and scenes of long lines at gas pumps in the Southeast are causing new political hurdles for President Joe Biden just as he begins negotiations with Republicans over major new spending proposals,2
Speaking from the White House on Thursday,2
Biden sought to tamp down on panicbuying and warned gas station owners against price gouging,2
He listed a series of administration steps meant to alleviate fuel shortages,2
he acknowledged the results of those efforts wouldn't be felt immediately,2
The White House this week has scrambled to contain the fallout of a pipeline shutdown at the same time new figures showed a spike in inflation and last week's monthly job report reflected turmoil in the labor market,2
and the pipeline shutdown was prompted by Russia-based ransomware hackers who penetrated a weak private sector network,2
Administration officials say the other matters are the expected blips of an economy emerging from a catastrophic pandemic-related crisis,2
the elements have caused new pressures for a President eager to enact sweeping new legislation while also cultivating Republican support for at least part of his plans,2
new violence erupting between Israelis and Palestinians has drawn Biden's attention to a fresh foreign crisis,2
"Biden sought to aggressively head-off the gas crunch through waivers and other means, but the problems are likely to persist as the network gets back online",2
"Administration officials and Cabinet secretaries have come to cameras to update reporters in the White House briefing room each of the past three days, a sign of the intense focus inside the West Wing on the matter. Biden himself dedicated a morning event Thursday to the Colonial Pipeline incident",2
Biden said in his remarks,2
We expect the situation to begin to improve by the weekend and into early next week,2
the President also warned providers against price gouging,2
Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain,2
The flurry of activity reflected heightened awareness of the politically fraught nature of gasoline prices,2
which can affect Americans in every part of the country and cause a drag on elected officials' popularity,2
Biden was first updated on the situation while at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland over the weekend and has been monitoring it intensely all week,2
according to officials,2
He has taken credit for easing regulations on transporting fuel on highways,2
and other agencies have also loosened rules that would allow gas to flow more easily amid the crunch,2
"long lines of cars at pumps and hand-written ""no fuel"" signs made for potent imagery that Republicans are pointing to as a sign that Biden's economic policies aren't working",2
Biden is likely to describe the steps the administration has taken to alleviate the fuel issue and mention the executive order he signed Wednesday seeking to harden government systems against cyberattacks,2
but administration officials tell CNN they hope the order,2
Biden is also likely to use the time to make a pitch for his infrastructure plan,2
saying the nation's critical systems need to be better protected against hackers,2
The President has spent this week pressing congressional leaders on his plans,2
But the economic headwinds could make his pitch harder,2
Republicans are citing inflation numbers as a sign that the President's economic policies are failing,2
including the two Republicans who Biden met in the Oval Office on Wednesday,2
That should terrify every American,2
said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,2
standing outside the White House after an Oval Office meeting,2
said they raised concerns about inflation with Biden during their meeting,2
even though they described the session overall as productive,2
The White House continued to publicly downplay inflation concerns on Wednesday,2
saying the new data reflects pent-up consumer demand that some suppliers cannot immediately meet,2
Press secretary Jen Psaki said administration economists,2
including those at the Federal Reserve,2
have anticipated short-term bursts of inflation that will recede as the economy returns to normal,2
That's something that we have prepared for and that most economists say will be temporary,2
But leading Democratic economist Larry Summers used the troubling numbers to urge the White House to shift course away from distributing Covid relief funds,2
Policymakers at the Fed and in the (White House) need to recognize that the risk of a Vietnam inflation scenario is now greater than the deflation risks on which they were originally focused,2
"disagree with Summers and administration economists remain confident in their ""go big"" approach",2
cautioning against overreacting to a single month's disappointing numbers,2
While they monitor conditions for signs of lasting problems,2
they continue to find encouragement in employment and output growth,2
one administration official said,2
Uber and Lyft to provide free rides to vaccination sites as part of new White House partnership,2
President Joe Biden announced additional steps toward promoting vaccine accessibility,2
"including free rides on Uber and Lyft to vaccination sites, to help meet the administration's goal of 70% of adults getting at least one coronavirus shot by July 4",2
Uber and Lyft will provide free rides to and from vaccination sites until July 4 as part of a new partnership with the White House,2
Biden confirmed on Tuesday,2
Biden said during a virtual meeting with governors at the White House on Tuesday,2
The White House did not allow members of the press to observe the event,2
as is typical of Biden's events each day,2
The event was instead live streamed online by the White House,2
White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients detailed the new steps in a call with governors on Tuesday,2
and Biden will highlight the program during a virtual meeting with a bipartisan group of governors on Tuesday afternoon,2
"The White House shared information on the location of about 80,000 vaccination sites with the ride share companies and the two companies plan to promote the free rides in their apps",2
the White House said in a statement,2
Lyft and Uber are eliminating a potential barrier and driving America closer to the President's goal of getting 70% of the U.S. adult population with at least one shot by July 4th,2
the administration is ramping up vaccination sites with new partnerships with the nation's community colleges,2
the White House said in the statement,2
"And Biden said the new initiatives being rolled out on Tuesday will make ""it easy for students who will work with federal pharmacy partners to bring on-campus vaccine sites to dozens of the nation's largest community colleges this summer.""",2
"The President also announced additional funding for state, territorial, tribal and local governments for ""community outreach and engagement.""",2
Biden asked the governors about their states' best practices in getting Americans vaccinated,2
It also comes one week after Biden set a new goal of administering at least one vaccine dose to 70% of the population and having 160 million US adults fully vaccinated by July 4,2
according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,2
Biden's 'core conviction' drives his push to tax corporations and the rich,2
"President Joe Biden's steadfast belief in taxing corporations and the rich has become a central plank in his legislative agenda, even as he's warned of political peril and red lines from Republicans",2
some of whom Biden hosted in the Oval Office on Thursday as he seeks a bipartisan infrastructure deal,2
cognizant of the political backlash past increases have wrought,2
Top business lobbying groups are already laying the groundwork to attack the proposals and considering the kind of moneyed opposition that simply didn't materialize in Biden's successful $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan,2
But to view those increases through a purely political or even technical policy lens is to miss what animates Biden's attachment to them,2
Biden's calculated decision to spend the past two weeks highlighting those increases in nearly every public appearance,2
the President's tax proposal is an issue of fairness and Biden is not shy about explaining why it's a necessity in this moment,2
That conviction will be put to the test as the President dives back into bipartisan talks over an infrastructure package he has proposed financing through corporate tax increases,2
The six Senate Republicans slated to visit the Oval Office Thursday have each made clear that tax increases are a non-starter,2
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after a nearly two-hour Oval Office meeting with Biden that included his House counterparty,2
We both made that clear to the President,2
Biden has made clear he wants to see if there's space for a deal,2
White House officials and key Democrats in Congress have been exploring different vehicles and pathways to pursue a bipartisan measure,2
It's something White House officials say they haven't taken off the table,2
though one senior administration official said it's not something Biden personally has warmed to at this point,2
"The President's red lines are inaction and are anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year",2
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week,2
the idea that Biden would back off his proposed method for financing that proposal is exceedingly unlikely,2
Biden has delved into what he sees as the overarching story of his tax proposals in nearly every public appearance since his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress in increasingly personal and off-the-cuff terms,2
He's taken to ad-libbing lines in his prepared remarks to underscore that he's not out to punish the rich but that he instead sees it as necessary to rebalance the current US economic system,2
Biden told reporters last week,2
But he's taken to turning questions about those potential policy compromises not as a way to lay out red lines for a negotiation,2
Biden actually wants to talk about raising taxes,2
though White House officials will gladly offer up reams of data that show it does just that,2
though White House officials make clear that's exactly what it does,2
Biden said in his prime-time address,2
Biden and his top advisers spent much of the day leading up to the speech focused on refining the 15 paragraphs laying out his tax proposals,2
one that Biden made clear to advisers he needed to get right,2
one that needed to tell the story in way that the American public would understand,2
Biden knows the policy details,2
but has more often taken to speaking in sweeping terms about shifting the economic paradigm in the country,2
"A separate adviser said Biden is indeed aware of the polling, but that it's simply not the issue he gravitates toward when talking about why he's so deeply engaged in his proposal",2
He regularly speaks in private meetings of this being a moment that could be looked back on 50 years from now as the time the US changed the direction of a country beset by a near-term public health crisis and a long-term crisis driven by economic inequality,2
a rising China in particular,2
Next year's elections could test if the political backlash for tax increases,2
Republicans have attacked the proposals as designed to stifle economic growth,2
something many Republicans cite as a cornerstone legislative achievement,2
Biden has proposed a seven-point increase,2
Biden has repeatedly said he doesn't want to add to the deficit,2
It's the story Biden and his advisers believe resonates,2
it's also one in a candid moment in front of reporters Biden acknowledged isn't an easy sell,2
But it's a story in which the President makes clear he doesn't view the tax increases in isolation,2
Migrant children have been in US custody for weeks,2
Now the Biden administration has to reunite them with families,2
she waits day in and day out to be released to a relative in the United States,2
"is one of the more than 20,000 minors in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of a record number of unaccompanied children and teenagers arriving at the US southern border this year",2
The Biden administration has scrambled to assist the department's already-strained resources and are using a host of novel locations,2
While the administration has made inroads in quickly transferring children out of jail-like Border Patrol facilities,2
reuniting an unprecedented number of children with family or guardians in the United States,2
Officials have been grappling with the situation along the US-Mexico border and its ramifications since the early days of the administration,2
The administration faced swift criticism from both sides of the aisle for their handling of the border,2
while immigrant advocates slammed officials for continuing to rely on a Trump-era policy that allows the swift expulsion of single adults and families attempting to illegally cross the US southern border,2
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on the actions that have been taken to address the influx of minors at the US-Mexico border,2
Federal documents obtained by CNN reveal shortages in the number of case managers needed at six temporary facilities,2
to try to locate their daughter after she crossed the US-Mexico border,2
Dangerous conditions in Latin America are among the contributing factors for migration to the US,2
The region was also hit with two devastating hurricanes last year and continues to reel from the coronavirus pandemic,2
Republicans draw 'red line' on increasing taxes to fund Biden's infrastructure plan,2
"Republican leaders say they told President Joe Biden on Wednesday that they're drawing a ""red line"" on hiking certain taxes to fund the President's infrastructure spending proposal",2
an anticipated hurdle that has arisen during a crucial week for the White House's infrastructure priorities,2
The discussion between the GOP leaders and Biden took place during the President's first bipartisan meeting with the top four members of congressional leadership at the White House,2
Senate Republicans are not interested in revisiting the 2017 tax bill,2
I think the President and the vice president understand that,2
You won't find any Republican that will go and raise taxes and that's the worst thing you can do in the economy,2
and it has not been this high since President Biden was vice president,2
Biden told MSNBC he'll try passing aspects of his infrastructure bill without Republicans if they cannot garner bipartisan support,2
even if Republicans don't want them included in an infrastructure bill,2
And then fight over what's left and see if I can get it done without Republicans if need be,2
Liz Cheney lost her position in the House Republican leadership for repeatedly publicly rejecting former President Donald Trump's lie that he won the 2020 presidential election,2
The House Republican Conference is expected to replace Cheney with New York Rep,2
according to an administration official,2
"McCarthy voted against certifying Biden's win in the Electoral College in the hours after the January 6 riot at the White House and McConnell has said publicly that ""100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration.""",2
as well as the ouster within the House Republican Conference,2
in a nod to the explosive meetings between former President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders,2
"Biden said he came away from them as ""encouraged""",2
"Republicans would only agree to discuss physical infrastructure including roads, bridges and broadband",2
He also pressed Biden to move any potential bill through regular order in Congress,2
That exhortation comes after Biden's massive Covid relief bill moved through Congress using reconciliation,2
No one at the White House was under any illusions that a deal would be struck on any major issue during the first joint meeting between Biden and the four congressional leaders,2
but the President saw it as an important avenue for reaching out across the aisle,2
The President has been clear from as far back as his campaign that he believes these discussions and engagements are important in and of themselves,2
a senior White House official said ahead of the meeting,2
Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and other Republican senators as an avenue for progress on infrastructure,2
the White House has intensified its negotiations with members of Congress over Biden's broad spending proposals,2
Members of the administration have said they have a goal of seeing real progress on infrastructure legislation by Memorial Day,2
White House staff held a series of internal meetings over the weekend to prepare for this week's meetings and have stayed in close contact with lawmakers and congressional staff on infrastructure,2
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has worked the phones with daily calls to lawmakers to discuss the administration's proposals,2
Biden is meeting with several members of Congress this week to move his plans on infrastructure forward,2
at the White House earlier this week,2
which could greatly affect the size and scope of the President's legislative agenda,2
Biden signs cybersecurity executive order,2
President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday meant to better protect the nation from cyberattacks,2
the White House acknowledged more will need to be done to prevent the type of hack that affected the Colonial Pipeline,2
which temporarily shut down the pipeline supplying fuel to the eastern United States this week,2
"The order would require new standards on software used by the federal government, including adding encryption and multi-factor user verification to new technology",2
The government plans to roll out a rating system akin to restaurant health grades to rank products based on their cybersecurity,2
A senior administration official likened the new requirements and labeling to purchasing a minivan with reliable ratings or building an earthquake-proof building in an area prone to seismic activity,2
