House Republicans voted on Friday to elevate Rep.,2
Elise Stefanik?to the No. 3 leadership position of conference chair after ousting Rep,2
Liz Cheney from the role because she repeatedly called out?former President Donald Trump's "Big Lie"?that the 2020 election was stolen.,2
"but his candidacy was viewed as a long-shot, and the New York congresswoman had the backing of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Trump.",2
"The final result was 134 votes for Stefanik and 46 for Roy,",2
The congresswoman?said in a statement after the vote?that she is "honored and humbled" to be elected to the leadership post.,2
"""House Republicans are united in our focus to fight on behalf of the American people to save our country from the radical Socialist Democrat agenda,"" she said.",2
Stefanik's rise within the ranks of House GOP leadership and Cheney's removal starkly?underscores the Republican Party's entrenched loyalty?to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent even after Trump's election lies incited a deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6.,2
"Amid Trump's false claims over voter fraud, Stefanik supported an objection during the Electoral College vote count to affirm President Joe Biden's win.",2
She also signed on in support of an amicus brief backing a lawsuit from Texas to the Supreme Court that sought to overturn the results of the election in several states.,2
Trump stood by Stefanik in her run for the leadership post and weighed in on Roy's late entry into the race Thursday evening with a statement slamming the congressman and reiterating his support for the congresswoman.,2
"""Can't imagine Republican House Members would go with Chip Roy",2
Stefanik has made a pitch to House Republicans that she will help deliver on a message of unity and united opposition to Democrats in Congress and in the White House as the party works to win back the House majority in 2022.,2
"McCarthy congratulated Stefanik on her election at a news conference after the vote, before pivoting to criticism of Democrats.",2
adding that Republicans had "a healthy debate and a good election.",2
Stefanik did face pushback from some conservative House Republicans in her bid for leadership.,2
The congresswoman represents a district that pivoted in the past from voting for former President Barack Obama to Trump and she has long been known on Capitol Hill as a more moderate Republican.,2
"And while the congresswoman has made a name for herself as an ardent Trump supporter in recent years, that wasn't always the case.",2
Stefanik talks with US Rep. Will Hurd in July 2019 as former special counsel Robert Mueller testified to the House Intelligence Committee about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.,2
"In 2015, 2016 and the early days of his term in office,?she criticized Trump on a range of issues?from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions",2
"?such as overhauling NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia.",2
"?she criticized Trump on a range of issues?from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions,",2
"such as overhauling NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia.",2
"Stefanik emerged as one of the President's most outspoken defenders, taking on Democrats and earning Trump's praise as ""a new Republican star.""",2
"Cheney, on the other hand, is known as a more conservative Republican, but she has also?become a major Trump critic.?",2
She voted to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol and has continued to speak out against his election lies.,2
"Before the vote, the Wyoming Republican called out Trump and other Republicans who aided his efforts to overturn his loss and warned,",2
"""we cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.""",2
"The House Freedom Caucus, a group of Trump-aligned far-right Republicans held a forum with Stefanik on Wednesday evening,?",2
"""My message was I'm focused on unifying the conference and beating Democrats and we have an opportunity to do that,",2
Stefanik also met this week with the conservative Republican Study Committee in her efforts to win over the conference.?,2
"?That group is led by Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who was seen early on as a potential contender in the race, but never entered.",2
Stefanik has signaled to some colleagues that she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022,2
wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress,2
"After years of encouraging Democrats and voters to take a meritocratic approach when evaluating candidates for office,?",2
Republicans are coming under fire for insisting that ousted House GOP Conference Chair?Liz Cheney?must be replaced by another woman.,2
Before the Wyoming congresswoman was booted from her leadership post in a vote on Wednesday,2
House Republicans had sent out clear signals that her successor would need to be a woman.,2
"Male members who had reportedly been interested in the role, such as Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana,",2
"Soon, party leaders settled on Stefanik, a millennial congresswoman whose profile rose in late 2019 amid her fervent defense of then-President Donald Trump during his first impeachment inquiry.",2
"Born out of what leadership saw as a political necessity given the party's precarious position with women voters,",2
"?Even in conversations between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Trump,",2
"The former President eventually offered a public endorsement, describing Stefanik as a ""gifted communicator"" in a statement on Monday.",2
"""They thought it was going to do damage in the media if they tapped a man for the job,"" said one top Trump ally,",2
describing discussions that occurred around Cheney's ouster between the former President and House Republicans.,2
"Instead, the hurried push to install Stefanik as GOP chair -- a vote that is expected to come on Friday",2
"?in this case, preventing the party from having three men occupy its House leadership ranks -- over ideological consistency.",2
We're almost at the anniversary of Joe Biden saying he needs to pick a woman as a running mate.,2
"This is what the Democrats always do and I'm against it,"" said the top Trump ally.",2
"""No GOP woman cares about identity politics!",2
?the Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin contended that the "most obvious reason" Republicans had settled on Stefanik,2
"whose voting record has raised eyebrows among the party's most conservative members,",2
"""is because the party -- though it supposedly abhors identity politics -- needs a skirt to hide behind as it jettisons a strong, independent-minded female colleague.""",2
One House GOP staffer agreed with Rubin's assessment.?,2
"?The anointing of Stefanik, this staffer said, represented ""rank hypocrisy"" inside the party, noting that Republicans have often cast quotas that are aimed at addressing gender diversity inside American companies",2
"presidential Cabinets, and other institutions as pandering or empty symbolism.",2
"We can't consider these other candidates, who are more attuned to what our constituents want, because they are men",2
Top Democrats have also seized on the GOP's push to swap Stefanik in for Cheney.?,2
the California Democrat accused Republican leaders McCarthy and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of seeking to replace Cheney with "a woman who isn't a 'threat' to them.",2
"To be sure, not every House Republican has supported the Stefanik-for-Cheney leadership swap.",2
"Efforts to coronate Stefanik as incoming conference chair come as the GOP finds itself in perilous territory with female voters,",2
?who contributed to the Democratic Party's suburban gains in the 2020 election and could stymie Republican hopes of retaking the House next fall if the relationship remains strained.,2
Republicans need to flip at least five seats to take over the lower chamber,2
and some worry that Cheney's orchestrated removal from leadership will further alienate women right as the party is ramping up for its critical midterm push.,2
?if the reaction to Stefanik among conservative House Republicans is any indication.,2
and urged Republicans to consider leaving the position of conference chair open if the party can't coalesce behind "someone who reflects our conservative values.",2
?Roy and other?conservative skeptics?have cited Stefanik's votes against the House GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Trump administration's request to use emergency funds for border wall construction as red flags.,2
They have also pointed to her sharp criticism of Trump over his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and rhetoric on trade.,2
"""The lack of any challenger doesn't remove any questions I have about her voting record and whether her positions are going to interfere with our ability to look to message for the conference,""?",2
"Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, where Stefanik's voting record and past criticism of Trump has become a source of consternation in recent days, told CNN on Wednesday.",2
"?It is not yet clear if his candidacy would pose a significant threat to Stefanik, who has privately suggested she would only serve in the role through 2022 and has already received the backing of McCarthy, Trump and Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican.",2
"Former Republican Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who became the first woman to occupy the role of conference chair when she was elected to the position in 2003,",2
said she was pleased that Republicans are likely to maintain female representation in their leadership ranks if Stefanik is voted into the role.,2
who held the title of GOP conference chair from January 2013 through January 2019.,2
Though Republicans made significant strides in the last election to add women to their congressional minority,2
"including with the help of Stefanik, whose leadership PAC gave $415,000 to Republican candidates in 2020",2
?A study by the Pew Research Center released earlier this year found that 38% of Democrats in the 117th Congress are women,2
versus 14% of Republicans. A Republican woman has also never served as party whip or House Speaker.,2
Rep. Chip Roy says he'll challenge Stefanik for Republican conference chair,2
Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said Thursday he is running to challenge GOP Rep.,2
Elise Stefanik?of New York in her bid to become?the next Republican conference chair.,2
"""I'm running,"" Roy told CNN on his way to a closed-door forum on Capitol Hill, where Republican House members were scheduled to hear from Stefanik on Thursday evening.",2
"Republican sources say the election will begin at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday for House Republicans to select their new No. 3, where Stefanik is widely expected to prevail.",2
"who was ousted by House Republicans from the position on Wednesday following her prolonged and public feud with former President Donald Trump,",2
though some lawmakers have criticized Stefanik's relatively moderate voting record and the speed at which she appears on track to take the position.?,2
Stefanik has been endorsed?for the position by Trump?and members of?House GOP leadership.,2
Trump reiterated his support for Stefanik after Roy made public that he would get in the race.,2
"Roy, a member of the far-right and Trump-aligned House Freedom Caucus",2
Roy said that while he has respect for Stefanik his concern is the pace at which the vote to fill the post is happening.,2
He argued that he thought it was "purposeful" to try to "jam" the vote through.,2
Members of the Freedom Caucus have asked Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to delay the vote beyond Friday.,2
House GOP rebuffs Cheney's demands to call out Trump's election lies,2
Rep. Liz Cheney?told House Republicans in private?on Wednesday that it's time to reject former President Donald Trump's big lie that he won the election because failing to do so will "make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.",2
But GOP lawmakers don't want to hear it.,2
"From the most conservative members to ones in swing districts, a wide range of Republicans either back Trump outright,",2
"?eager to avoid becoming mincemeat for Trump, who is demanding total loyalty despite?his evidence-free argument?that the election was rigged.",2
"Many argue more investigation is needed over mail-in voting even though Trump's own Justice Department determined there was?no evidence of widespread fraud,?",2
all 50 states certified their elections and the former President and his allies?lost in dozens of court cases including?before the US Supreme Court,2
"""No one knows about what happened in the election,""?",2
And some say that Trump truly won — roundly dismissing his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.,2
"Rep. Jody Hice, a Republican?running for secretary of state?of Georgia with Trump's support, said that the former President would have a won his state ""if there was a fair election.""",2
"Asked if he believed Trump actually won reelection in 2020, Hice said in an interview: ""I believe if it was a fair election, yes. I believe absolutely.""",2
"Indeed, Cheney's view?represents a minority of the House GOP Conference",2
an uncomfortable reality for House GOP leaders who recognize that relitigating the validity of the 2020 elections is not a winning message heading into the 2022 midterms when control of Congress is at stake.,2
And that was a big reason why Republican leaders were eager to eject Cheney from her No. 3 spot,2
"""The vote today was nothing about Liz Cheney's vote for impeachment or anything else along that line,""",2
even as the GOP leader himself did so after the November election and later joined efforts in Congress and the Supreme Court to throw out Biden's electoral votes.,2
"""I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,""?",2
?"I think that is all over with sitting here with the President today.",2
Yet Stefanik herself?voted to overturn Biden's victory in Pennsylvania?and signed onto a Texas lawsuit aiming to overturn the electoral results across a number of battleground states that the Democrat won.,2
"?And in recent days, Stefanik has reaffirmed her support for an effort by Republicans in Arizona to cast doubt and review Biden's win",2
"?while also doubling down on Wednesday when asked about her dubious claim of 140,000 unauthorized votes being cast in Georgia.",2
"""I stand by my statement that there are serious issues related to election irregularities in the state of Georgia, as well as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin,"" Stefanik told reporters.",2
"But when pressed if she still believes that those votes were illegitimate,?",2
"Some Republicans did push back against Trump's claims, but they amount to a rarity among the House GOP.",2
"Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican?who has been sharply critical of his leadership team?and has been vocal in his support of Cheney,",2
"""Not if that election was today,""",2
many of whom are in line with the notion that there was something amiss last November with the influx in mail-in voting that saw a sharp uptick during the coronavirus pandemic.,2
"""I think there were a lot of anomalies in the election,"" said Rep. Bill Johnson,",2
"""And I think there was clear evidence of some states that violated their own state election laws and their Constitution -- thereby the federal Constitution.""",2
Republicans won't call Biden's win 'legitimate',2
"Yet efforts to challenge state election rules?fell flat in the courts,?though that fact has yet to convince a wide swath of House Republicans.",2
"""I've said all along that we should look into the concerns millions of Americans have, including millions of Democrats have, about the election;",2
But many sidestepped when asked if Biden's victory amounted to a legitimate one,2
"""Yeah he's the President, I've said that all along,"" Jordan said when asked if Biden's win was legitimate.?",2
"Asked again if he thought Biden won legitimately, Jordan added: ""Like, our system, the way it works, he's the President.",2
We know he's the President. Look at what the last four months have been like.",2
"Asked a third time if Biden were legitimately elected,",2
"Jordan added: ""I do think we should look at the election results but, yeah, he's the President of the United States, I've said that all along.""",2
"Rep. Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican who is considering a Senate bid,",2
?said this when asked if he's accepted the notion that Biden won legitimately: "I have accepted that he won. I think that there were irregularities.",2
"Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican",2
said that while he "never had any doubt" Biden would win?,2
"?that Trump and others should move on from the election dispute, he didn't say outright that Biden won legitimately won asked multiple times.",2
". Asked again if he thought Biden's win was legitimate,",2
"""He won the Electoral College vote. And where there are irregularities and multiple states? Yes. Did he make those irregularities? No.""",2
Issa would not say if Trump was responsible for the riot at the Capitol aimed at stopping certification of Biden's win.,2
"House Republicans, though, are clearly irritated that Cheney has injected these questions back into the fray.",2
rebuffed Cheney's demands that Republicans should push back on Trump's election lies.,2
That's what I want to talk about. You guys want to keep talking about Donald Trump.",2
The freshman began to walk away when asked if she believes the election was indeed stolen from Trump,2
as the former President continually claims. "Are we still talking about this?" Malliotakis said.,2
But some Republicans do plan to keep a focus on the elections were conducted.,2
"Tenney, the New York Republican, said she and 28 other Republicans have formed ""an election integrity caucus"" and she asked Cheney to join them.",2
"""I've tried to engage her on what's happening in my election integrity (caucus), she doesn't want to talk about it,"" Tenney said.",2
Tenney said she sent Cheney a "nice message" over text but got pushback from her colleague over the election matter. "I got sort of a bloody step back.",2
Five takeaways from the first New York City Democratic mayoral debate,2
The New York City?Democratic mayoral primary?has been playing out in the shadows -- of the Covid-19 pandemic,2
"?of?President Joe Biden's first months in office, and former President Donald Trump's?corrosive election lie.",2

"Brooklyn borough president and former police officer Eric Adams, civil rights lawyer and former de Blasio counsel Maya Wiley,",2
?former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan and ex-Citigroup executive Ray McGuire all took part -- Hollywood Squares-style -- in the two-hour debate.,2
"Despite a handful of pointed jabs, the candidates mostly used the occasion to introduce themselves to voters first tuning into the race.?",2
But a few themes quickly emerged -- none more prominent than how the candidates would combat a citywide rise in deadly gun violence.,2
"Yang also managed a potentially tricky exchange with Adams, who took exception to the former presidential primary candidate's talk about working in Georgia earlier this year to help two Democrats win their Senate runoff elections.",2
"But Yang took the air out of the ball, crediting Abrams and then noting that Asian Americans made up nearly 5% of the Georgia electorate.",2
?Adams began by claiming that "there is no one on this Zoom" with the breadth of experience he's had on policing and public safety issues before stressing "prevention and intervention",2
He also noted that the overwhelming majority of both alleged shooters and shooting victims were people of color.,2
"Wiley and Morales, two thirds of the progressive bloc in this primary along with Stringer, made strong first impressions -- and yes, this was the likely the first time many New York voters really dug into the campaign.",2
"Stringer began the debate by arguing that his decades of experience in city government made him the most prepared to manage the city's recovery -- a point he made, as he's done on the trail, by warning about a mayoralty ""on training wheels.""",2
"They never did -- and the debate, despite it all, was largely glitch-free, although the lightning round questions in which candidates were asked to raise their hands for or against a given policy probably didn't land, despite the moderators' best efforts, with radio audiences.",2
GOP Sen. Tim Scott on policing overhaul: 'I think we have a long way to go',2
"Republican Sen.?Tim Scott?of South Carolina offered a blunt assessment on Thursday of where things stand in the?bipartisan effort to craft a compromise to overhaul policing in the US,?telling CNN, ""I think we have a long way to go.""",2
"?himself, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California?",2
There has been pressure from President Joe Biden and advocates of changing the nation's policing laws to have a deal by the?one-year anniversary of George Floyd's death?on May 25.,2
"""But what is more important to me than not is that we have a substantive piece of legislation that is transformative for policing.",2

and warning that former President Donald Trump is willing "to unravel the democracy to come back into power.",2
"The Wyoming congresswoman, and now former House Republican Conference chair, also didn't rule out a run for president in the ""Today"" interview that aired Thursday morning, but she did confirm she will run for reelection for her US House seat next year.",2
"Cheney said ""silence is not an option"" when?speaking out against Trump,?",2
and she said admonishments from her fellow Republicans to move forward are not possible because the damage that the former president is causing is "an ongoing threat."?,2
The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated her assertion Wednesday that Trump cannot become president again.,2
". ""And I think you've watched over the course of the last several months, the former President get more aggressive,",2
Cheney lost her post in the House Republican leadership on Wednesday after publicly rejecting for months Trump's lie that he won the 2020 presidential election and calling out the former President for his role in inciting the January 6 deadly riot at the Capitol.?,2
"The House GOP conference ousted Cheney by voice vote?during a 16-minute meeting, and she's likely to be replaced by Republican Rep.?Elise Stefanik?of New York.",2
"Cheney said she is ""very focused on making sure that our party becomes again, a party that stands for truth, and stands for fundamental principles that are conservative.",2
And mostly stands for the Constitution and I won't let the former President or anybody else unravel the democracy. Whatever it takes.",2
She called the former President's hold on the party "very dangerous" and "a cult of personality.",2
"""I think people were betrayed and misled by him,"" Cheney said. ""It's a real betrayal. He's going to unravel the democracy to come back into power.""",2
"As for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Cheney said he is ""not leading with principle right now"" and called a recent visit to Mar-a-Lago to see the former President ""stunning.""",2
"She also placed blame at the feet of McCarthy, a California Republican, saying he is ""not leading with principle, and I think that is sad and I think it's dangerous.""",2
"Cheney pressed fellow Republicans to embrace a bipartisan January 6 commission to get to the truth of what happened on that day,",2
?I have been very public that that commission needs to be bipartisan.,2

"Among the Republican conference, 95 of the 212 members -- 44.8% -- have said they are vaccinated.",2
One hundred and twelve Republican offices did not respond to multiple CNN inquires.,2

President Joe Biden and the White House?are showing little willingness to bend to pressure from liberal Democrats calling for more robust condemnation?of Israel's actions amid the?worst regional violence?in years.,2
"Later, press secretary Jen Psaki declined to say whether?Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?on the growing Palestinian civilian death toll in a telephone conversation on Wednesday.",2
"And a readout of Biden's phone call with Netanyahu said he ""shared his conviction that Jerusalem, a city of such importance to people of faith from around the world, must be a place of peace.""",2
"But in his public statements on the crisis, Biden has hewed toward staunch support for Israel, despite calls from within his own party to adopt a tougher stance.",2
?Biden said at the White House when asked whether Netanyahu is doing enough to stop violence from escalating.,2
His answer reflected the longstanding view of both Republicans and Democrats that Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks from Hamas,2
Biden has only spoken publicly about the increasing Middle East violence when questioned at the end of events.,2
But officials are also mindful of the delicate -- and somewhat new -- political pressures Biden is facing on the matter.?,2

It's wrong,"" wrote Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Twitter.",2
"Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, responding to the White House's readout of Biden's telephone call with Netanyahu, decried its lack of mention of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.",2
"""You aren't prioritizing human rights. You're siding with an oppressive occupation,"" she wrote.",2
"Psaki, questioned about those statements, said Thursday the US was opposed to any civilian deaths.",2
"?whether they're the Israelis or the Palestinians, or leaders from other countries who can play an integral role in influencing Hamas, to de-escalate and move toward a more stable peace,"" she said.",2
"As Hamas continues sending a barrage of rockets into Israel, and Israel pounds Gaza with airstrikes, the White House is closely watching nascent ceasefire negotiations led by Egypt to bring an end to the violence,",2
"On Wednesday, Biden said he believed the crisis would not be prolonged after his conversation with Netanyahu. But he did not say what role the US would play in bringing it to an end.",2
The White House efforts at engaging with the Palestinians to stem the violence are limited.,2
"Administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have spoken to President Mahmoud Abbas.",2
"He has little control over Hamas or Gaza and there is an inherent limit to the amount of influence the US can exert on the situation because the US does not engage with Hamas, which the nation labels a terror organization.",2
"Instead, officials say telephone lines at the White House and State Department have been blinking non-stop since the violence began over the weekend with calls to other regional players.",2
The White House said Wednesday there had been more than 25 calls and meetings among senior US officials and regional counterparts.,2
"Encouraging and monitoring those efforts is one of the primary current objectives of the White House amid the crisis, officials said.",2

"In a scathing letter sent to colleagues on Tuesday, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said Stefanik's voting record ""embodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats""",2
?and urged Republicans to consider leaving the position of conference chair open if the party can't coalesce behind "someone who reflects our conservative values.",2
and the Trump administration's request to use emergency funds for border wall construction as red flags.?,2
They have also pointed to her sharp criticism of Trump over his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and rhetoric on trade.,2
"""The lack of any challenger doesn't remove any questions I have about her voting record and whether her positions are going to interfere with our ability to look to message for the conference,""",2
"Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, where Stefanik's voting record and past criticism of Trump has become a source of consternation in recent days, told CNN on Wednesday.",2
"?who has privately suggested she would only serve in the role through 2022 and has already received the backing of McCarthy, Trump and Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican.",2
"Pryce, who described Cheney's ousting in an interview with CNN as ""very unfortunate,"" said she was pleased that Republicans are likely to maintain female representation in their leadership ranks if Stefanik is voted into the role.",2
"?following Cheney and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who held the title of GOP conference chair from January 2013 through January 2019.",2
Though Republicans made significant strides in the last election to add women to their congressional minority?,2
"including with the help of Stefanik, whose leadership PAC gave $415,000 to Republican candidates in 2020",2
?the party still pales behind Democrats in female representation.,2
"A study by the Pew Research Center released earlier this year found that 38% of Democrats in the 117th Congress are women, versus 14% of Republicans. A Republican woman has also never served as party whip or House Speaker.",2
"Emerging from the White House after a meeting with President Joe Biden on infrastructure Wednesday,?",2
and her vote to object to the 2020 Electoral College results.,2
"""Well, first of all, the conference will decide but I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,""",2
So what McCarthy is saying here is that no one is questioning the legitimacy of the election? That Biden won and Donald Trump lost? No one?,2
"Not the 139 House Republicans, including Stefanik, who objected to the Electoral College counts in Pennsylvania and Arizona on January 6 -- despite the fact that every state had verified its count and there was zero proof of any sort of fraud or tampering? Or the eight Republican senators who did the same?",2
"""The major Michigan Election Fraud case has just filed a bombshell pleading claiming votes were intentionally switched from President Trump to Joe Biden.",2
The number of votes is MASSIVE and determinative. This will prove true in numerous other States. All Republicans must UNIFY and not let this happen.,2
The Fake News media refuses to cover the greatest Election Fraud in the history of our Country.,2
"The whole world is laughing at us as we go to hell on our Borders, our fake Presidential Election, and everywhere else!""",2
"""The 2020 Election, which didn't even have Legislative approvals from many States (which is required under the U.S. Constitution), and was also otherwise corrupt, was indeed The Big Lie.",2
You get the idea. The simple fact is that the current edition of the Republican Party is a cult of personality built around Trump. And virtually the ONLY thing Trump has talked about for months now is how the election was stolen from him.,2
And the only reason that Stefanik is going to be elected as the next Republican Conference Chair is because McCarthy led the charge to remove Wyoming Rep.,2
"?Liz Cheney from that job because she voted to impeach Trump for his conduct before, during and after the US Capitol riot on January 6.",2
What's remarkable is that the most likely outcome of this neat bit of gaslighting by McCarthy is that he will likely earn a rebuke from Trump.,2
Because Trump has attacked anyone and everyone who won't sign on to his Big Lie about the 2020 election.?,2
"?Which will, of course, prove how ridiculous McCarthy's claim that nobody is questioning the legitimacy of the election actually is.",2
President Joe Biden on Thursday touted?new mask guidance?from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "a great day for America" and an important milestone in the US coronavirus response.,2
"Appearing maskless during remarks in the White House Rose Garden, Biden said, ""You have endured all this.",2
"?When your country asked you to get vaccinated, you did. The American people stepped up. You did what I consider to be your patriotic duty. That's how we have gotten to this day.""",2
"In a sign of the Biden administration's embrace of the guidance, the White House emailed staffers Thursday telling them they no longer have to wear a mask on the complex's grounds if they are vaccinated, an official told CNN.",2
"While Biden trumpeted the new guidance Thursday, he still stressed the need to continue?vaccinating at an aggressive clip?in order to drive transmission numbers lower.",2
So much attention has been focused on?the rift in the GOP?over former President Donald Trump's antidemocratic?lies about the 2020 election.,2
"But Democrats have their own brewing disagreement over how the US should react to?violence between Israelis and Palestinians, leading Democrats to question?President Joe Biden's commitment to human rights and?demanding he do more?to pressure Israel.",2
"?liberals want to apply similar notions of justice to foreign policy, where an increasing number see apartheid in Israel's approach to the Palestinians.",2
Vocal liberals have criticized the White House for placating Israel and ignoring human rights as violence mounts,2
as well as loudly criticizing Biden for not openly opposing Israel's planned evictions of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in east Jerusalem.,2
Biden spent much of Saturday preparing for and placing telephone calls to leaders in the region,2
"Biden has spoken and been briefed by senior level aides, but, ultimately, officials acknowledge the President's ability to broker a ceasefire on his own is limited.",2
"Officials say as the violence between Israelis and Palestinians stretches into another week, he is keeping very close tabs on developing efforts by regional partners -- including Egypt and Qatar -- to broker a ceasefire.",2
