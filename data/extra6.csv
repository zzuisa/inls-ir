The agreement is a major concession from the executive branch after the Trump administration sought to broadly block former and current officials from testifying to Congress,2
McGahn's recalcitrance ended up in court as the most potentially consequential case over testimony,2
Yet the agreement comes after much of the political jeopardy Trump faced as president passed,2
"When the former President vowed to fight 'all of the subpoenas' aimed at his Administration,",2
he began a dangerous campaign of unprecedented obstruction.,2
"We begin to bring that era of obstruction to an end today,",2
Mueller wrote in 2019 he was documenting the instances of obstruction so that Congress or future investigations could pick up the ball.,2
 The special counsel left the decision of whether to indict Trump for obstruction of Justice to then-Attorney General William Barr,2
"""The big lie has taken hold",2

Cheney lost her post as the No. 3 House Republican on Wednesday morning,2
The conference is expected to replace her with Rep.,2
"Cheney did not back down in a speech before the vote,",2
 calling out Trump and other Republicans who aided his efforts to overturn his loss ,2
"All three are enlisted members of the US Army and stationed at the Fort Campbell military installation in Clarksville,",2
. Investigators found multiple firearms at the scene of the shooting.,2
"Five of the firearms were found to have been recently purchased from federal firearms licensed dealers in the Clarksville, ",2
They were expected to appear before a US magistrate judge in Nashville on Tuesday. ,2
". An attorney is not listed for Adams, Brunson and Miller, according to online records.",2
"The Wyoming lawmaker is billing her brave stand against the former President's stolen election lies as the beginning of a new quest to restore the GOP's respect for the rule of law,",2
"I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,",2
"Trump may have left Washington,",2
Another problem for Cheney and those who want to restore their party is that the former President's deceitful brand of politics has taken over.,2
"The Democratic governor donated $500,000 from his book deal to the United Way of New York State for pandemic relief",2
"""There was no insurrection,"" said Rep. ",2
"""peaceful patriots"" ",2
"Georgia's Rep. Jody Hice, suggested outside agitators were to blame for the violence.",2
like the question of how the insurrection was able to happen.,2
"While Cheney's warning that Trump represents a threat to US democracy with his continuing lies about a stolen election was a chilling and historic moment,",2
,2
 The conduct of some Republicans is another indicator of his continuing resonance in a party Cheney wants to reform.,2
Cheney's hopes of building a genuine anti-Trump movement that makes a vigorous conservative attack on Biden's ambitious policies are also handicapped by the former President's bond with GOP voters.,2
McCarthy's decision to strongly ally his caucus with Trump as he launches a midterm election campaign and the unwillingness of most Republicans to speak out against Trump are not taking place in a vacuum.,2
" Politicians have an innate understanding of opinion in their own districts, especially when it comes to their own survival.",2
There are some slim signs of hope for a new generation of Never Trumpers.,2
An NBC News poll taken at the end of Biden's first 100 days in office found that the ex-President's approval rating may be easing among GOP voters. ,2
Some 44% of Republicans said they are more supporters of Trump than of the party.,2
But 50% said they were more supporters of the party than of Trump.,2
The former President's overall approval rating of just 32% was also a reminder of the damage that promoting Trump could do in a wider electorate,2
"Nevertheless, there's little doubt that if the next presidential primary were starting now, ",2
"And if he decides not to run in 2024, the maneuverings of potential candidates like Florida Gov.",2
the GOP base will have the luxury of choosing a candidate in his image rather than one pledging to re-create a more traditional notion of conservatism.,2
Cheney's first problem might be retaining her platform in Washington. ,2
"And if she is forced to build her movement outside front-line politics, ",2
"her disloyalty to Trump is hardly likely to endear her to the conservative news networks with direct access to the GOP grass roots, ",2
who like McCarthy have decided that the former President remains their meal ticket.,2
We must go forward based on truth.,2
We cannot both embrace the big lie and embrace the Constitution,2
Cheney's mission to save the GOP from itself has left her with a small band of allies and an even smaller chance of success.,2
"her disloyalty to Trump is hardly likely to endear her to the conservative news networks with direct access to the GOP grass roots,",2
"This is not a third party, but a movement",2
I don't think I would characterize it so much as a third party as a coalition,2
 I don't think a third party necessarily works in the kind of political system we have with a single member districts,2
But there is a need for people who have a conservative to moderate point-of-view,2
want to believe in the rule of law and they need a place to go and a place where they can organize and support candidates that are consistent with that.,2
" as well as 27 former members of the US House of Representatives,",2
Other members of the group include former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci;,2

But I urge everyone to exercise the greatest caution because the choices we each make in the coming days will have a material effect on the road ahead.,2
The government's aim with the fourth and final step of the roadmap is to remove all legal limits on social contact on 21 June,2
will be no limits on gatherings indoors or outdoors ,2
 nightclubs will be allowed to reopen and there will be no limits on weddings.,2
The government has said easing restrictions on 21 June depended on its four tests being met,2

FBI agents raided Giuliani��s New York City apartment and office to seize phones and computers as part of an investigation of whether Giuliani violated the law in his work for foreign entities,2
Justice Department investigators have asked questions about Rudy Giuliani��s work connected to Romania,2

"Joe Biden, to help put an end to the fraud investigation against him",2
Hunter Biden had reportedly stopped working for Popoviciu by the time Giuliani got involved in 2018,2
Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment.,2
A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment.,2
Giuliani��s consulting firm also worked with a state-run energy firm in Qatar,2
The Supreme Court��s Monday decision to reconsider the right to an abortion drags President Joe Biden into an incendiary political fight that will loom large heading into the mid-term election,2
"Biden largely stayed quiet on the issue while Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and other Democratic contenders took the lead in putting forward sweeping abortion rights policy platforms. ",2
"He conceded when pressed, however, that the landmark Roe v",2
Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide should be written into federal law and the longtime ban on federal funding for abortion should be abolished,2
he hasn��t mentioned abortion in any speeches,2
"Now, they��re calling on Biden to speak up ",2
It��s important for the administration to be specific,2
It��s incumbent on them to use the bully pulpit to shine a light on these attacks and show they��re standing up for access to sexual and reproductive health care including abortion.,2
Advocates are hoping that includes Biden following through on his campaign vow to champion federal bills,2
The White House declined to say what steps the administration will take to defend abortion rights.,2
The abortion fight even hangs over Biden��s forthcoming fiscal 2022 budget.,2
Progressive advocacy groups are pressing Biden to get rid of the long-standing ban on federal funding for abortion,2
Saying you want to codify or save Roe isn��t sufficient,2
We need from Biden a full-throated plan and a vision for abortion access in this country. ,2
He needs to figure out what he can do administratively and figure out what pressure he can put on Congress.,2
"The Supreme Court won��t hear the Mississippi case until the fall,",2
any decision likely would not come down until the following spring or summer during the run-up to the 2022 midterms.,2
The Biden administration could take a wait-and-see approach,2
"but there��s going to be a lot more demands put on them to act,",2
We can��t let an attack on Roe open the floodgates to a barrage of anti-choice laws that smother the opportunities of women,2
While the U.S. is already a patchwork of abortion access,2
the procedure would immediately become illegal in nearly half of the states.,2
"The Biden administration seems to have concluded, up until now",2
"that there was no reason for them to say anything about abortion,",2
"Until now, it was something easier for him to finesse and sidestep",2
"But when the Supreme Court puts it front and center, he can no longer do that",2
"Val Demings is planning to run for the U.S. Senate, rather than governor,",2
providing Democrats with a big-name candidate to take on Republican Sen. Marco Rubio next year.,2
"I would��ve supported her running for governor, but this is the right fit for her and for us,",2
"She��s going to draw a contrast between who she is and how she represents Florida vs. Marco Rubio, who a lot of people where I live never see him.��",2
"Sink said she was recently on a Zoom call with Demings and activists with Ruth��s List,",2
it was clear that she and national Democrats felt she would represent the party��s best chance to put Republicans on defense as they try to take back the U.S. Senate.,2
"Demings, 64, was first elected to the House in 2016 from Orlando and held the distinction of being the city��s first Black woman police chief.",2
"By running for Senate, Demings leaves the gubernatorial field to Rep.",2
Demings expects to make her decision final as early as next month.,2
Val is an impressive and formidable candidate whose potential entrance would make the race against Rubio highly competitive,2
Even Demings�� supporters acknowledge Rubio will not be easy to beat. ,2
He has won two statewide general election races already ,2
"Hispanic voters still favor Democrats overall in most polls and in Florida general elections,",2
but the 2020 election results unnerved national Democrats.,2
About 17 percent of the state��s registered voters are Hispanic and 14 percent are Black.,2
"In recent election cycles, Democrats have failed to conduct the voter registration drives necessary to boost their standing in the state,",2
but national and state Democrats say they plan more field work to change that.,2
Demings was one of the first Democrats we backed when we were formed in 2016 and since that point,2
" she's been a rising star in politics,",2
The Collective helped push Andrew Gillum over the top in the crowded 2018 Democratic primary for governor,2
but he narrowly lost to DeSantis in the general election.,2
We came very close with Gillum,2
But now we're back with a really great candidate.,2
We're going to do all the things,2
" Demings is more moderate in tone and policy,",2
"James said, ��so Republicans can��t call her a socialist.��",2
But an element of the Democratic base has grown increasingly critical of law enforcement,2
and that could be a challenge for Demings because of her background.,2
aren��t really anti-police. They��re against police brutality.,2
She said the bigger challenge for Demings was the one that Democrats throughout the state face: voter registration and turnout.,2
"��If we don��t register our voters and get them out, we��re not going to win,�� Sink said.",2
"��Joel Greenberg has now confessed to falsely accusing an innocent man of having sex with a minor,��",2
"The Republican lawmaker previously had said that it��s Greenberg who has admitted to the crime,",2
 is trying to escape a lengthy prison sentence and has also pleaded guilty to falsely accusing a political rival of being a pedophile.,2
He��s looking at so much time that the only reason you would plead guilty to something like this because A,2
"you have absolutely no defense or B, you��re looking for the reduction in sentence of the century,",2
"Greenberg first met the sex-trafficking victim on a website for ��sugar babies�� seeking ��sugar daddies,��",2
"according to the plea agreement, confirming an earlier POLITICO report concerning the website",2
"SeekingArrangement. According to the plea, Greenberg paid her explicitly for sex at least seven times after meeting her on April 24, 2017.",2
"Greenberg contacted the Minor, directly and through one of the Minor's friends,",2
"As POLITICO has reported, several senior White House officials �� including some on the White House Covid-19 task force",2
CDC did not warn them until the morning of the announcement that vaccinated people can forego masks in most situations.,2
"When Biden entered office, there were some very early conversations about how the CDC was going to be handled",2
who was going to lead it and what it needed to do to get back on track,2
Walensky was chosen for the top job and was highly sought-after,2
And I think we��re starting to see the CDC director make some moves to change things,2
reorganized the incident management structure to best suit each phase of the nation��s response to COVID-19,2
previous reorganizations added efficiencies and improved collaboration.,2
My sense is that there has been more and more real world data that has emerged that has guided the CDC in its decision making,2
There will be confusion over the next several weeks,2
Everyone has to develop their own comfort zone with the guidance.,2
Health officials and experts across the country decried the new CDC advice,2
I would expect the CDC to recommend to local and state public health departments that when your vaccination coverage is at this level,2
The CDC just can��t win. First they are told that they are being too careful,2
too cautious with masks and travel,2
"Normally I yield to another member to do that, but I thought that was very important that day.",2
 Cheney either has a spine of steel or a streak of self-sabotaging stubbornness,2
But other Republicans aren��t so sure. ,2
"They argue Cheney may have seen a brighter future, and surely a safer one",2
"If she had run for the Senate and won, she'd be a rank-and-file senator.",2
Would it be such a big deal? ,2
who endorsed now-Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) before Cheney decided not to enter the race. ,2
"She wouldn't have a leadership position to lose, plus she'd have a six-year term. It'd be a lot different.",2
The elder daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney has been known to harbor greater political ambitions.,2
I don't think she's political roadkill. She's too smart and she comes from,2
"If she does [run again], that's a sad day for the Republican Party �� maybe in the Democrat Party",2
I'm not gonna lose my seat.,2
Your legacy gets written when you're done. I don��t think Liz is done yet,2
"It's going to require consistent hard work and effort by a lot of people,",2
and a willingness by people to stand up and talk about what's right,2
I don't think that it's certainly going to happen overnight,2
"We��re dealing with countries that are experts on misinformation,",2
and the only way you can really combat misinformation is to try to stop it as soon as it comes out,2
"From what I understand it hasn��t had to be used yet, which tells you that maybe the State Department reformed themselves to the point where it didn��t have to be used",2
There is a very strong emerging ground in the Democratic Party that wants to see an American policy that is balanced,2
"We think that this is becoming the center of the Democratic Party,",2
 but they're also urging Biden to speak up.,2
Democrats are dinging the Israeli government for what they see as a counterproductive crackdown on Palestinians within its own borders,2
prompting lawmakers from both parties to forcefully condemn the aggression and assert Israel��s right to defend itself from an enemy that believes it should not exist,2
Israel��s controversial settlement activities are threatening to force Palestinians from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of east Jerusalem,2
 in what was seen as the precursor to the violence that's exploded in the region over the past few weeks,2
We��re in this moment today because Hamas made a horrible mistake and fired rockets unprovoked into Israel,2
While Biden��s top deputies have privately relayed their concerns about the settlements and possible evictions,2
By not speaking out more directly against Israel��s activities,2
It is difficult to believe an American president would consider removing terrorism or missile-related sanctions at the very moment Iranian rockets are raining down on Israel,2
"When I see those pictures with her mom, I see my story in there,",2
Harris carried many firsts with her into the vice presidency,2
"Black person, Asian American, Indian American and biracial woman to serve as vice president.",2
"But with the likelihood that she may one day run for president again,",2
 she has some more balancing to do. Since she was sworn in,2
she has chatted with civil rights activist-turned-TV anchor,2
" the Rev. Al Sharpton, about her African American heroes and participated in numerous interviews with news outlets geared toward Black audiences from Chicago to San Francisco.",2
"She made an unannounced stop at the old Woolworth��s lunch counter in Greensboro,",2
where four Black college students refused to give up their seats in protest six decades ago,2
"But they want her to speak out more about her Indian heritage,",2
"embracing it as she does her Black roots, and advocate for policy issues important to Asian Americans,",2
"They say the need has never been more pronounced,",2
Gopalan raised her daughters to be Black women,2
"The flood decimated parts of our region, including the complete destruction of entire neighborhoods, disruption in power",2
Politicians and activists of Asian descent have cheered Harris�� ascent,2
"We work hard to make sure our CAPs reflect our fence-line neighbors, community business owners and other local stakeholders",2
"They��ve been really good about involving everyone,",2
"We��ve invested a lot in technology �� the ability for people to remote work �� and we��re being very careful and following the science,",2
I think that everybody espouses the overall position that you need to be vaccinated to take care of yourself,2
We are planning to begin a phased approach to bring those White House staff who have been working remotely back to campus later this summer. ,2
"As we do so, we will continue to follow COVID protocols that have been developed in close consultation with our public health experts and advisors",2
All Zoom calls and phone calls for now still,2
The White House press briefing room is still limited to 14 reporters,2
The biggest sign the presidency is inching back to normal is Biden��s travel,2
 the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,2
" Jill Biden will be in Utah, Nevada and Colorado this week. ",2
" the former CEO of the Democratic National Committee, who is in touch with administration officials, said in-person meetings between White House officials and lawmakers have been different because of vaccination schedules",2
"We do take some extra precautions for him because he is the president of the United States,",2
But I would say that people should follow the CDC guidelines,2
"and they should take advantage of getting the vaccine, getting fully vaccinated, ",2
" and taking that mask off, particularly as the weather grows so beautiful and we all want to be outside",2
with a hope of expanding to 50 percent occupancy in the press room over the next several weeks,2
which would mean roughly 25 reporters at a briefing.,2
"Fewer guests, masks, social distancing and pooling arrangements for the media are the primary precautions we are taking this year due to Covid-19,",2
"The question is, what if there is a manufacturing problem or a contamination or a barrier, and then all of a sudden we don't have enough vaccines,",2
Their opponents urged Biden to wait until the U.S. had authorized more shot makers and was further along in its own vaccination campaign.,2
There��s people �� pushing to do it and do it now.,2
"Then there are people who are saying ... we'll deal with it, but not right now, let's just wait a little bit.",2
"Top federal officials involved in the nation��s Covid-19 response are also trying to sort out whether there is support in the White House,",2
" to launch a sustained effort this year to export doses overseas, according to two other people with knowledge of the situation.",2
"Sharing vaccines could help accelerate the end of the pandemic, and lower the chance that additional variants will emerge.",2
A White House spokesperson responded to a series of questions on the matter by pointing to coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients' statement Tuesday that the U.S.,2
"""strong portfolio"" of existing vaccines made it possible for the administration to share AstraZeneca doses with other countries.",2
Others inside the administration have countered that there is little cause for concern. ,2
Administration officials across the White House,2
the manufacturing capacity is going to ramp up pretty significantly.,2
"The debate came to a head in early March when a cross-agency group focused on the Covid-19 response that included top staffers at HHS,",2
citing concerns about future production issues and the need to ensure the U.S. can meet demand at home.,2
the administration is identifying other ways to export critical supplies such as ventilators and personal protective equipment. ,2
This is no longer a conversation about protecting American lives versus protecting Indian lives,2
 like America has plenty of vaccines,2
Americans will have plenty of vaccines for a long time.,2
we should be doing is helping places like this institute make a lot more.,2
The big question is how are we going to build these EVs here at home?,2
Biden��s American Jobs Plan proposes to spend $174 billion on transportation electrification.,2
" In addition, he said, EVs will likely be cheaper than gas-powered vehicles within five years.",2
buildings and more to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas pollution by 2050.,2
"Their bill, the CLEAN Future Act, seeks sweeping changes to the power sector",2
mandatory rush to green.,2
"Upton touted his own bill, which would allow mining of critical minerals at home.",2
the security impacts of the United States trading its strategic advantage in fossil energy for more reliance on supply chains from China.,2
there is no consideration for American workers or car buyers,2
"We��re in a unique time,",2
"There��s a power of now, a real sense we need to get to work on the big things we haven��t done since FDR. And there��s a new sheriff in town.",2
Biden��s most senior White House climate aides are all former managers of large agencies who are now content just to have the president��s ear. ,2
"I��m completely obsessed with creating clean energy jobs,",2
" and Joe Biden is obsessed, too",2
There��s definitely an all-in ethos on this team.,2
There just isn��t much subtlety about the Biden team��s enthusiasm for climate action.,2
"The assumption is that climate isn��t just aligned with the economic agenda, it is the economic agenda,",2
We don��t have to marshal evidence every time to make the case.,2
"The only jobs Joe Biden is creating are for far-left special interest groups in Washington, D.C.,",2
Biden��s approach to climate is obviously a radical shift from the Trump Administration,2
We felt like we were doing all of it on our own,2
There��s a sense of working together for a common cause that I��ve never seen in my previous government experience,2
This administration has attracted the advocates,2
It��s not an afterthought you need to force into the conversation,2
it��s front and center on every agenda,2
It makes you feel like you��re in the right place.,2
"We��re worried he��ll accept the Wall Street idea that climate action can happen voluntarily,",2
"Those of us who have worked on this for so long, we see an opportunity to be useful,�� Lubchenco says.",2
"So far, all the data points show that this administration is serious about doing things that aren��t incremental,",2
"We��re at a critical moment in the story arc of our species,",2
"To work on these issues at this scale, it��s a dream come true to be part of it.",2
