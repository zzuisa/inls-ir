President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday meant to better protect the nation from cyberattacks,2,
"but even as he signed it, the White House acknowledged more will need to be done to prevent the type of hack that affected the Colonial Pipeline",2,
"That attack, which temporarily shut down the pipeline supplying fuel to the eastern United States this week",2,
caused gas stations to run dry and gas prices to spike as Americans flocked to the pumps in a spurt of panic buying.,2,
"Instead, officials described the order -- months in the making -- as an initial step toward hardening the systems and software that underpin the country's basic functions",2,
"Going forward, Congress will need to act to require the private companies that control much of the nation's critical infrastructure to do the same.",2,
The order would require new standards on software used by the federal government,2,
 The government plans to roll out a rating system akin to restaurant health grades to rank products based on their cybersecurity,2,
A senior administration official likened the new requirements and labeling to purchasing a minivan with reliable ratings or building an earthquake-proof building in an area prone to seismic activity,2,
"The growing number and impact of incidents show us software security has to be a basic design consideration, the official said",2,
The order would also create new protocols following a hack,2,
requiring agencies and companies to share information with the federal government in the hopes of preventing the incident from spreading,2,
A new panel will be created to review cybersecurity incidents similar to the transportation board that investigates plane crashes.,2,
The order is limited to products and companies used by the federal government,2,
But administration officials said they were hopeful the government's vast purchasing power would spur other companies to follow suit in order to remain competitive,2,
 And many of the products used by the government -- including Microsoft's Outlook platform and Juniper's networking products -- are used widely in the private sector,2,
The order comes after a string of cyber incidents caused widespread disruption in the United States,2,
"They include the SolarWinds breach, which allowed hackers sponsored by Russia's intelligence service access to US government agencies",2,
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities exposed earlier this year,2,
"and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, which has caused fuel supply disruptions in the southeastern United States.",2,
A senior administration official said those incidents shared commonalities,2,
 including poor software security and "a laissez-faire attitude toward cybersecurity.",2,
"For too long we've failed to take steps to modernize our cybersecurity defenses because doing so takes time, effort and money. Instead we've accepted we'll move from one incident response to the next, the official said.",2,
"Still, officials acknowledged that companies like Colonial Pipeline will not necessarily be subject to the requirements for federal contractors, even if the trickle-down effect on software would apply to their networks.",2,
"Instead, an official expressed hope that both private companies like Colonial and lawmakers looking to draft cybersecurity legislation would look to the new executive order as establishing ""goalposts"" for further action.",2,
Republican leaders say they told President Joe Biden on Wednesday that they're drawing a "red line" on hiking certain taxes to fund the President's infrastructure spending proposal,2,
an anticipated hurdle that has arisen during a crucial week for the White House's infrastructure priorities.,2,
The discussion between the GOP leaders and Biden took place during the President's first bipartisan meeting with the top four members of congressional leadership at the White House.,2,
Meeting attendees included Vice President Kamala Harris,2,
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat",2,
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican; and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican.",2,
"After the meeting, McConnell and McCarthy told reporters that almost all of their hour-and-a-half meeting was about infrastructure and that they both made clear that they're not willing to budge on the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by former President Donald Trump, calling the issue the GOP's ""red line.""",2,
"I think that it is safe to say there is certainly a bipartisan desire to get an outcome, McConnell said.",2,
"Clearly, Senate Republicans are not interested in revisiting the 2017 tax bill. I think the President and the vice president understand that.",2,
He also said individuals in the room agreed that they'd next work on how they would be defining infrastructure.,2,
McCarthy argued that "raising taxes would be the biggest mistake you could make.",2,
"""You won't find any Republican that will go and raise taxes and that's the worst thing you can do in the economy -- when you are watching inflation, gas prices are going up,",2,
" and it has not been this high since President Biden was vice president,"" McCarthy said.",2,
"In an interview Wednesday after the meeting, Biden told MSNBC he'll try passing aspects of his infrastructure bill without Republicans if they cannot garner bipartisan support",2,
"He said he wasn't willing to abandon priorities like expanded child care, even if Republicans don't want them included in an infrastructure bill.",2,
"We're going to fight those out. I want to know what we can agree on, and let's see if we can get an agreement, kick start this.",2,
"And then fight over what's left and see if I can get it done without Republicans if need be,"" he said in a clip thata aired on Wednesday.",2,
He said the issue of how the infrastructure bill would be paid for did not arise,2,
and instead centered on what should be labeled "infrastructure" -- and what the two sides could agree to pass as such.,2,
"I got into what constitutes infrastructure. And I want to make it clear: I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on. And that means roads, bridges, broadband, infrastructure, Biden said.",2,
"But I'm not giving up on the fact we have 2 million women not able to go back to work because all the daycare centers are closed, out of business, so they can't go back to work.",2,
" I'm not going to give up on a whole range of things that go to the question of productivity, increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing revenues. I'm not willing to give up on that.""",2,
Liz Cheney lost her position in the House Republican leadership for repeatedly publicly rejecting former President Donald Trump's lie that he won the 2020 presidential election,2,
The House Republican Conference is expected to replace Cheney with New York Rep,2,
"Elise Stefanik, who has a less conservative voting record than Cheney but has emerged as one of Trump's top defenders.",2,
"Wednesday's meeting marked McConnell and McCarthy's first time in the West Wing since Biden took office, ",2,
according to an administration official,2,
While Biden has kept up public promises to find bipartisan areas to compromise,2,
both McConnell and McCarthy have -- at least publicly -- largely promised they'd do everything to stop Biden's agenda.,2,
That opposition has taken different forms -- McCarthy voted against certifying Biden's win in the Electoral College in the hours after the January 6 riot at the White House and McConnell has said publicly that "100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration.",2,
"But those topics, as well as the ouster within the House Republican Conference, were not on the agenda.",2,
"And following their time in the Oval Office, none of the parties had indicated those political issues were brought up.",2,
 McCarthy mentioned that the group briefly discussed the violence that has erupted between Israel and Palestinians.,2,
"The meeting was ""businesslike,"" according to one official, with each participant getting to make their case on their views of an infrastructure bill",2,
"several exchanges on specific policy issues and what could be included in any package, but no clear pathway forward beyond continuing discussions.",2,
"This isn't like the last four years, and I don't think anyone expected it would be, the official said,",2,
in a nod to the explosive meetings between former President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders. ,2,
There wasn't a lot of overt political talk -- just a focus on where each side stood.,2,
"The position laid out by Republicans underscored that the two sides remain far apart on a myriad of issues, the official said.",2,
"There was agreement, however, that the discussions needed to continue as they sought to narrow down areas of potential agreement.",2,
While the discussions were characterized by participants as productive -- Biden said he came away from them as "encouraged",2,
" McConnell and McCarthy made clear several times to Biden and their Democratic counterparts that the tax increases proposed by Biden were non-starters, a separate official said",2,
"Beyond that, the issue of how to pay for the proposals -- by far the thorniest issue at play -- wasn't a primary focus of the discussions.",2,
McConnell made clear that beyond the tax issue,2,
"Republicans would only agree to discuss physical infrastructure including roads, bridges and broadband.",2,
"He also pressed Biden to move any potential bill through regular order in Congress -- a committee process, followed by floor consideration",2,
That exhortation comes after Biden's massive Covid relief bill moved through Congress using reconciliation,2,
a process that allowed it to pass with only Democratic support.,2,
"Separately, McConnell brought up concerns he's raised publicly related to inflation and the effect of the expanded unemployment benefits on hiring, the official said.",2,
No one at the White House was under any illusions that a deal would be struck on any major issue during the first joint meeting between Biden and the four congressional leaders,2,
but the President saw it as an important avenue for reaching out across the aisle,2,
"The President has been clear from as far back as his campaign that he believes these discussions and engagements are important in and of themselves,",2,
a senior White House official said ahead of the meeting.,2,
"Even though Wednesday's meeting is the big ticket item this week, the White House is equally -- if not more -- focused on Thursday's meeting with Sen.",2,
Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and other Republican senators as an avenue for progress on infrastructure.,2,
"In recent days, the White House has intensified its negotiations with members of Congress over Biden's broad spending proposals. ",2,
"Members of the administration have said they have a goal of seeing real progress on infrastructure legislation by Memorial Day, which is just about two-and-a-half weeks away.",2,
"White House staff held a series of internal meetings over the weekend to prepare for this week's meetings and have stayed in close contact with lawmakers and congressional staff on infrastructure, a White House official said.",2,
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has worked the phones with daily calls to lawmakers to discuss the administration's proposals,2,
"Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm this week is courting bipartisan members of Congress,",2,
"governors, and stakeholders in the labor and business sectors, another official told CNN.",2,
Biden is meeting with several members of Congress this week to move his plans on infrastructure forward.,2,
"He met with key moderates, West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Democratic Sen.",2,
"Kyrsten Sinema, at the White House earlier this week, as well as longtime ally Sen.",2,
"Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who has worked with Biden for decades.",2,
"Manchin and Sinema are key votes, as both Democrats oppose changing the Senate's rules to allow legislation to pass with a simple majority instead of the required 60-vote threshold needed to end debate",2,
which could greatly affect the size and scope of the President's legislative agenda.,2,
"For a month, Meybelin has lived in a massive convention center located in the heart of San Diego. ",2,
"There, along with hundreds of other migrant children, she waits day in and day out to be released to a relative in the United States,",2,
 frequently calling her parents in El Salvador distraught about the prolonged wait.,2,
"Meybelin, 17, is one of the more than 20,000 minors in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of a record number of unaccompanied children and teenagers arriving at the US southern border this year.",2,
"The Biden administration has scrambled to assist the department's already-strained resources and are using a host of novel locations, like convention centers, to shelter minors.",2,
While the administration has made inroads in quickly transferring children out of jail-like Border Patrol facilities,2,
it now faces another daunting challenge: reuniting an unprecedented number of children with family or guardians in the United States.,2,
"In more than 80% of cases, children who cross the US-Mexico border alone have a family member in the US",2,
according to the Department of Homeland Security. But getting them to those relatives is a timely and often arduous process.,2,
Officials have been grappling with the situation along the US-Mexico border and its ramifications since the early days of the administration,2,
"as an increasing number of migrants, particularly children, arrived.",2,
The administration faced swift criticism from both sides of the aisle for their handling of the border.,2,
"Republicans seized on Biden's immigration policies, arguing they're encouraging migrants to journey north,",2,
while immigrant advocates slammed officials for continuing to rely on a Trump-era policy that allows the swift expulsion of single adults and families attempting to illegally cross the US southern border.,2,
"On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on the actions that have been taken to address the influx of minors at the US-Mexico border.",2,
"For now, border arrests appear to have leveled off, but hurdles remain.",2,
" including the San Diego site, for the number of children in care, as well as an ongoing need to continue building bed capacity for children.",2,
"Federal documents obtained by CNN reveal shortages in the number of case managers needed at six temporary facilities,",2,
"For the children, the reunification process can be dizzying.",2,
"Meybelin's case, according to her family's attorney, has bounced around to different case managers,",2,
 pushing back her release and raising concerns among her family and attorney who say she suffers trauma after being attacked in El Salvador.,2,
"""What's frustrating about this case is there's a natural brother here, there's an attorney who knows what they're doing",2,
"You might expect that if you're calling Amazon about a lost package, but this is a child,"" said Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch",2,
"an immigration attorney based in Texas, referring to Meybelin's older brother.",2,
"Meybelin's parents, Jose and Mirna, spent roughly three weeks fretting over the whereabouts of their 17-year-old daughter who had fled their home country of El Salvador to journey to the US after, they say",2,
CNN is only using their first names due to privacy concerns.,2,
"""It hurt,"" Jose told CNN in Spanish,",2,
"Jose said he called the Office of Refugee Resettlement hotline every day, around the clock",2,
"to try to locate their daughter after she crossed the US-Mexico border. ""We called every day. They said we could call 24 hours,"" he said.",2,
"Nathan Bult, senior vice president of public and government affairs for Bethany Christian Services, which works directly with unaccompanied children",2,
 underscored the role of case managers and the stress they're under. ,2,
"""In Bethany's programs, which are licensed by each state we're in,",2,
our case managers have a caseload set by the license.,2,
"The ratios are meant to keep them from getting overwhelmed. But they're definitely stressed,"" Bult added.",2,
"More than 350 personnel from US Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency under DHS, are helping with case management.",2,
"The administration, officials told reporters last week, is improving some case management processes and updating policies to quickly unify children with their vetted sponsors. ",2,
"That includes implementing virtual case management, ",2,
"training additional case managers, and expediting the release of children to parents or guardians.",2,
President Joe Biden's two individual meetings with key Senate Democrats on his infrastructure plan,2,
" the first in a series of high stakes meetings at the White House this week -- were productive and revolved around shared goals, according to a White House official.",2,
"Biden hosted Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia for nearly an hour and Sen. Tom Carper, who hails from Biden's native Delaware",2,
for even longer in conversations designed to both take the temperature of two key committee chairmen and discuss paths forward on his top agenda item.,2,
"Biden's conversation with Manchin dealt primarily with the need to rebuild key infrastructure nationwide, the official said,",2,
The official said the conversation also had a keen focus on rural communities -- a priority for Manchin.,2,
"Carper, a long-time ally of Biden who -- as chairman of the of the Senate Environment and Works Committee ",2,
" will play a central role in crafting the infrastructure bill, discussed the need for meaningful investment infrastructure.",2,
The meetings with Manchin and Carper come in a crucial week for the White House,2,
with Biden set to meet later this week with the top four congressional leaders and a group of Senate GOP senators on infrastructure.,2,
Biden has made clear both publicly and privately he's genuine in his desire to see if there's a pathway toward a bipartisan agreement on spending for physical infrastructure.,2,
"While he has put a $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal on the table,",2,
he has said he is open to hearing ideas from Republicans and compromise -- to a point.,2,
Top Biden advisers describe Biden's intent as genuine -- and that he's willing to spend the coming days talking to Republicans to see if there is a pathway forward.,2,
"Manchin, a linchpin moderate for Senate Democrats, has also stated publicly he will not go along with any Democratic efforts to move forward unless there is an effort to find a bipartisan deal.",2,
"The Senate is split evenly with Vice President Kamala Harris positioned as the Democrats' tie-breaking vote,",2,
making Manchin a prominent figure in his party as he could make or break the President's infrastructure goals.,2,
"Speaking to reporters late Monday afternoon, Manchin described the meeting with Biden in positive terms but did not provide specifics of what a total price tag could be for a bipartisan compromise.",2,
"Carper, who hails from Biden's home state of Delaware and is close to the President,",2,
is known for maintaining good relationships with Republicans and is in the midst of bipartisan talks over surface transportation reauthorization bill that may serve as a vehicle for pieces of Biden's infrastructure proposal.,2,
"That has raised the stakes for the next few weeks,",2,
with the White House looking for progress by Memorial Day and more progressive Democrats itching to push forward on Biden's legislative plans as soon as possible.,2,
"A group of Senate Republicans, led by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, sent a $568 billion counter proposal to the White House last month",2,
"and staff-level discussions have been ongoing between the two sides in the days since. Biden and Capito spoke by phone recently, ",2,
and Capito will join a group of Senate Republicans in the Oval Office to meet with Biden on Thursday.,2,
"Federal officials from the US Secret Service have helped recover around $2 billion in fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief funds and seized more than $640 million from accused fraudsters, the agency said Wednesday.",2,
"One year into the pandemic, the Secret Service has opened 690 cases regarding unemployment insurance fraud, on top of another 720 Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Paycheck Protection Program fraud investigations and inquiries.",2,
"""The amount of unemployment insurance benefits provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in the history of the nation's unemployment insurance system,"" said Larry Turner,",2,
the acting inspector general for the Labor Department.,2,
"""Unfortunately, the significant increase in benefits made the program a target for those seeking to defraud government programs.""",2,
"In a recent hearing in front of House lawmakers, Secret Service Director James Murray said the agency's approach to recovering stolen funds has evolved over the last year from stopping scams to building robust prosecutions.",2,
Murray also noted the size of the Covid-relief packages from Congress are extraordinary and the work to root out fraud will continue long after the virus slows.,2,
"""We've probably made more than 120 arrests specific only to Covid fraud,"" Murray said.",2,
"""This is not something that is going to go away. The size of these packages are so notable and the opportunities that exist are going to be persistent",2,
we're going to be addressing Covid fraud for many years to come.",2,
"In March, the Justice Department announced federal investigators identified more than $500 million in fraud and charged 474 people with crimes related to stealing from Covid-relief designated funding.",2,
"Among the top targets by prosecutors were fraudsters trying to steal from the Paycheck Protection Program,",2,
with people running schemes ranging from exaggerating their business expenses to concocting fake companies to get funding. ,2,
"In one Texas case, a man pleaded guilty to seeking $24.8 million in PPP loans using the names of 11 different companies to make loan applications to 11 lenders.",2,
"He managed to obtain $17.3 million in forgivable loans and used the money to buy homes, jewelry and luxury cars.",2,
President Joe Biden's steadfast belief in taxing corporations and the rich has become a central plank in his legislative agenda,2,
even as he's warned of political peril and red lines from Republicans.,2,
"GOP senators, some of whom Biden hosted in the Oval Office on Thursday as he seeks a bipartisan infrastructure deal, have rejected them outright.",2,
"Some Democrats, cognizant of the political backlash past increases have wrought, have quietly warned of their unease.",2,
Top business lobbying groups are already laying the groundwork to attack the proposals and considering the kind of moneyed opposition that simply didn't materialize in Biden's successful $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan.,2,
"But to view those increases through a purely political or even technical policy lens is to miss what animates Biden's attachment to them, close advisers say.",2,
"Biden's calculated decision to spend the past two weeks highlighting those increases in nearly every public appearance,",2,
"in some of the most impassioned and personal terms, reveals his deep-seated belief that they are more than just a way to pay for his $4 trillion legislative agenda.",2,
"According to top advisers, the President's tax proposal is an issue of fairness and Biden is not shy about explaining why it's a necessity in this moment",2,
even if the current political landscape would lead many politicians to reconsider such a plan.,2,
"""Conviction really drives him,"" one of his closest advisers, Mike Donilon, told CNN in an interview",2,
 "It's a core conviction that's reflected in policy choices.",2,
That conviction will be put to the test as the President dives back into bipartisan talks over an infrastructure package he has proposed financing through corporate tax increases.,2,
The six Senate Republicans slated to visit the Oval Office Thursday have each made clear that tax increases are a non-starter.,2,
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after a nearly two-hour Oval Office meeting with Biden that included his House counterparty, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California.",2,
"""Clearly, Senate Republicans are not interested in revisiting the 2017 tax bill,"" ",2,
"""We both made that clear to the President. That's our red line.""",2,
Biden has made clear he wants to see if there's space for a deal. ,2,
"He's even told advisers he sees benefits for the country for a bipartisan physical infrastructure agreement, ",2,
even one much smaller than the $2.3 trillion he has proposed.,2,
"White House officials and key Democrats in Congress have been exploring different vehicles and pathways to pursue a bipartisan measure, officials say.",2,
Some Democrats have urged the White House to view infrastructure as long-term investment,2,
one that doesn't need to be financed on the front end.,2,
"It's something White House officials say they haven't taken off the table,",2,
though one senior administration official said it's not something Biden personally has warmed to at this point.,2,
"For now, only two red lines have been set.",2,
"""The President's red lines are inaction and are anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year,""",2,
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week.,2,
"But if the last several weeks are any indication, the idea that Biden would back off his proposed method for financing that proposal is exceedingly unlikely.",2,
Biden has delved into what he sees as the overarching story of his tax proposals in nearly every public appearance since his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress in increasingly personal and off-the-cuff terms.,2,
He's taken to ad-libbing lines in his prepared remarks to underscore that he's not out to punish the rich but that he instead sees it as necessary to rebalance the current US economic system.,2,
"We're not going to deprive these executives their second or third home, travel privately by jet, Biden told reporters last week. ",2,
It's not going to affect their standard of living at all. Not a little tiny bit.,2,
But I can affect the standard of living that people I grew up with.",2,
He's willing to compromise and pare back the increases for Democrats wary of their scale and Republicans dead set against them entirely.,2,
"But he's taken to turning questions about those potential policy compromises not as a way to lay out red lines for a negotiation,",2,
but instead as another opportunity to delve right back into the story of why he views them as so essential. That's not by accident.,2,
"""He very much believes that you need to give people a window into why you're doing it, a story you can follow to explain why you're going down this road, and repetition,"" Donilon said.",2,
But it's also an issue fraught with political risk.,2,
"A handful of moderate Democrats on Capitol Hill, while broadly supportive of the $4 trillion in infrastructure and economic proposals the President has put on the table, have signaled to leadership",2,
"in some cases, the White House directly -- that they are uncomfortable with the scale of the increases, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations.",2,
Each day that passes is one closer to a midterm election that Democrats enter with the slimmest of majorities in Congress.,2,
Next year's elections could test if the political backlash for tax increases,2,
"and the potent campaign trail issue they have been for Republicans -- still carries weight,",2,
even as the public polling underscores significant support for raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.,2,
"Republicans have attacked the proposals as designed to stifle economic growth,",2,
all in the name of significantly expanding the range of the social safety net.,2,
"They view any effort to revise the 2017 tax law,",2,
"something many Republicans cite as a cornerstone legislative achievement, as dead in the water.",2,
"A week of poor economic data, most notably a jobs report that significantly undershot economist expectations, only served to harden that opposition.",2,
"In interviews with nearly a dozen GOP members, most argued that they would be unwilling to raise the corporate tax rate even a single point to cover the cost of infrastructure.",2,
"Biden has proposed a seven-point increase, though he has opened the door to a smaller iteration.",2,
"""The problem I have with that is we just think it is one percent incremental revenue,",2,
"but I think we are going to see a contraction of economic activity that will consume most of that,"" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican. ",2,
Biden has repeatedly said he doesn't want to add to the deficit.,2,
"But more salient, advisers say, is how he views how the money raised from his proposed tax hikes can be deployed",2,
not just to long overdue investment in physical infrastructure,2,
"but also in his sweeping proposals on child-care, education and paid family leave.",2,
"It's the story Biden and his advisers believe resonates, with on adviser noting Biden's ""keen antenna"" for identifying and honing in on the issues that matter to Americans.",2,
"But when it comes to taxes, it's also one in a candid moment in front of reporters Biden acknowledged isn't an easy sell.",2,
"""I'm going to have to be able to explain this and I'm going to keep banging at it,"" Biden said.",2,
"But it's a story in which the President makes clear he doesn't view the tax increases in isolation,",2,
"as a pure policy play. To Biden, they represent an integral part of a broader, more overarching goal.",2,
"""He has a strong sort of fundamental belief of what's at stake,",2,
"and that these choices we're going to make, they're going to change a lot of people's lives in the long term -- or at least have the potential to,""",2,
The trauma lawmakers experienced on January 6 is rushing back as Democratic members say they are increasingly worried about a handful of Republican colleagues who have sought to downplay the events of that day or continue to tout lies about the election.,2,
"After months of concerns about external security threats,",2,
" the fears and mistrust among Republicans and Democrats inside the Capitol are looming large,",2,
unraveling decorum that had long been a hallmark of Congress and leading members to question the motives of their colleagues.,2,
"One Democratic House member, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely",2,
grew emotional recalling how the behavior in recent days from Republican colleagues has resurrected a lot of terrible memories of the January attack.,2,
"Asked if they're still concerned for their safety, the member responded: ""It's a complicated question, but the answer is yes.""",2,
Tensions escalated this week after an Oversight Committee hearing in which several Republicans argued that the events of the insurrection had been exaggerated ,2,
"Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Republican from Georgia, compared the insurrection to a ""normal tourist visit.""",2,
"On Wednesday evening, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, also of Georgia, confronted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. ",2,
"During the incident, first reported by The Washington Post, Greene caught up with Ocasio-Cortez and began shouting at her ",2,
"and asking why she supposedly supports antifa, a far-left activist group,",2,
"and Black Lives Matter, falsely labeling them ""terrorist"" groups.",2,
"The following day, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, appeared wearing a mask that said simply ""expel MTG,"" arguing leadership needed to bring to the floor his resolution to expel the Georgia congresswoman from Congress because she was ""a threat.""",2,
"Since the attack on the Capitol in January, security protocols inside the building have been expanded.",2,
Members now have to enter the House chamber through metal detectors,2,
" and while large portions of the external fence have come down, there is still increased security protections surrounding the building.",2,
But the repercussions of the fear provoked by the attack can't all be seen. ,2,
"Members say that in the months since January 6, relationships have been fractured and trust broken.",2,
"""Thank God Republicans aren't in charge of security here. Thank God we are in charge of it,"" Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Ohio, said.",2,
"Back in January, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""the enemy is within,"" ",2,
referencing the rhetoric and behavior of some Republican members of Congress.,2,
"Those tensions, Democrats say, have resurfaced after Republicans ousted Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from their leadership ranks for speaking up regularly about the election lies that led to January 6.",2,
"""I am supposed to be bipartisan with a guy who is like, 'na na na na,'"" Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey said,",2,
"referencing a tweet by GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina that said continued, ""hey hey, goodbye Liz Cheney.""",2,
"""Then you calm yourself down and say 'that's not all of them,' but they did just get rid of the one leader on their side who actually stood for serious governance and is not a moderate Republican,"" Malinowski said.",2,
"Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served three tours in Iraq alongside the US military as a CIA analyst before becoming a member of Congress,",2,
reacted to the growing number of Republican lawmakers downplaying the realities of the violent insurrection on January 6.,2,
"""I'm here to work with serious people. I'm here to work with people who care about their constituents, and who actually do the hard work of banging out legislation,""",2,
the Michigan Democrat said. "Either be here to do work or pipe down.",2,
"The fears and anger have been permeating for months,",2,
but the last several days just underscore the rawness and mistrust that still plague many lawmakers on Capitol Hill in the wake of January 6.,2,
"More than 100 House Republicans voted to overturn the results of the election in key states, ",2,
"including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who turned heads Wednesday after the vote to oust Cheney when he said,",2,
"""I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election.""",2,
As Republicans seek to move on from the insurrection,2,
Democrats say not enough is being done to learn from the cost of some of the mistruths that were promoted.,2,
Some Democrats are blanketly refusing to work closely with Republican colleagues who voted to overturn the election.,2,
"Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, made a decision not to let Republican Rep.",2,
"Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, be a lead cosponsor on the prescription drug bill she was sponsoring because he had voted to invalidate the results of the election.",2,
"""We came to a decision in my office that I need to take a stand,"" Dean said. ",2,
"""I will not lift up as a leader someone who did not vote to certify the election when that was connected to an insurrection.""",2,
"Dean said she offered to let him be a cosponsor,but not the lead",2,
"As a result of the move, Republicans sank the bill, but House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer vowed to bring it back up on the floor next week.",2,
"""She wanted me to apologize for objecting to the electoral certification and I made it clear that that was not going to happen,"" Carter told reporters earlier this week. ",2,
